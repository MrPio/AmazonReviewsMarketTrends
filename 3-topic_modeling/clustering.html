printer that prints quickly and also scans through the feeder quickly!","Photo print is great.","The only issue I can say that I have with this printer is the paper drawer sticks when pulling or

any issues.","Now I am using a hassle-free printer with no problems or page limits.","Please read the reviews, especially comments regarding connectivity issues.","Worked like magic!","SO in general I like it.","Way too invasive for me.","Very familiar with HP printers and therefore purchased another.","This is the third HP printer I have been forced to buy.",".Ughh.To be honest, It is such a task to install an HP printer and now they do not even include a .50 cent DVD with the drivers.","Truth in savagery, it's entirely possible I did something wrong during the installation, but was never able to get it right.","HP just now has its machines programmed to be paper weights unless you are actively subscribed to buy their toner!!!","We bought another brand and it has less ink so ran out fast.","Could be due to I do not use my printer very often","How they even monitor it is spooky!","It\u2019s been wonky since set up.","Printing through their HP Smart app, however, will make the print job go through.","Our office has ALWAYS used HP products.","I returned two out of frustration before deciding to just pay a little more and go back to Officejet, it's only been a couple of weeks but so far I don't think I'll have any regrets.Pros:+ Seems to be on sale often so it's not terribly more expensive than lower end printers.+ The print quality is very good.","I spent hours with HP support, who finally insisted it was an Apple issue\u2026even though my other HP printer would AirPrint fine.","Each time I try to use the printer I have to reconnect it to the modem.","Love this printer and I highly recommend this printer.","Worst functionality.","This replaced a WF2950 which, after a firmware upgrade, would no longer user 3rd party ink nor was the scanner recognized by Linux.","If you experience the above, I hope this helps you as well.Again, I find the printer to be overall fine in printing letters, scanning documents, and printing photos.","Low noise level, printing is fast and easy to follow instructions.","It won\u2019t even reboot easily.","They have certainly lost a customer because of their decisions to require only HP cartridges being used in a consumable product!","Only complaint is that it runs out of ink fast and you have to replace the ink with official HP ink as it will not read HP ink that isn\u2019t official.","It will say \u201cready\u201d and then as soon as I hit print it\u2019s back to \u201csetup incomplete\u201d.","AVOID this company.","Up until this one, never had a problemSet up was a bi#@h. Finally had to use wire instead of wireless, still took hours ti get it working.","Ink replacements already showed up so I will have no downtime.","This one had to be replaced within 3 months due to a broken carriage that would not allow the thing in front of the ink to be moved.","I downloaded the HP Smart app to my phone because that's the only way to connect it to a Wi-Fi network that I can tell.","?","This officejet is exacly what we needed.","Unlike so many other brands' printers, which won't let you print if your color cartridges are empty.","Finally got it to install the wireless drivers, but still having trouble getting it to install drivers for USB cable.","Additionally, the software glitched when I needed to print something urgently, incorrectly showing the printer as \"offline.\"","Very happy.","I've had trouble trying to log in just to try and scan some papers.","Instructions don't really help much and until you get it almost completely setup there isn't anyone to contact for help.","This lack of accountability from two major companies has been extremely frustrating.This entire experience has reaffirmed my loyalty to Canon.","The new one is combined with the other one I have so I can use these for work.","After trying to put the docs in the adf and copying, it would only copy and print one sided.","My old HP died so I got this model.","Now it is October and it stopped connecting to the wireless.","I'm not sure why but all the plastic trays and doors squeal when opened and closed.","extra ink arrived in days of our purchase.This all-in-one printer will print, copy,  and scan, and will do 2-sided printing.","Not Windows 11 compatible.","I know that's how they make money but I certainly expected to get more out the ink cartridges than only ~33% of what they advertise.","Plus $50 for 2 new ink cartridges equales another 1000 sheets of print.","!A few quirks but not enough to deter me from giving the printer a good review.The Canon was returned to WM.","I did a lot of research to pick a new printer and the reviews about the ink program was concerning.","I will throw it in the trash because I can't use it when I need it.Just for the record, I have used HP printers exclusively for over 20 years.","It starts making noises out of nowhere, even late at night.","I will be sticking with HP printers going forward since they seem to be Ubuntu friendly..","Also if you don\u2019t print a lot the ink gets dry and you have to run the alignment program numerous times.","I would have rather bought a Canon printer.","Now I\u2019m wasting a ton of ink cleaning and printing test pages.","I saved the earth from having one more plastic printer buried in it, paid an incredibly low price, and received incentive deals as well.","every time i try to use the buttons on the machine itself says i need to use the app on the laptop.","This little thing really keeps me on my toes.","We cannot fix it.","I have no idea how it actually works because, except for the test print sheet, I haven't a clue.","WiFi did not work right, printer would spool and clean heads for 5 - 6 minutes for each print job, this spooling\u002fcleaning used up the printer ink cartridges after 4 print jobs, the complicated task of faxing made it useless, placed a new HP ink cartridge and error code \"foreign cartridge\" rendered the printer useless.","It tells you of all the great features but it is easy to overlook the one part where it tells you that turning it on only allows you to use HP cartridges.","Glad I bought it as my prints are 100% improved.","It\u2019s a small pain point, but it might be something that would discourage other folks so it\u2019s best to disclose that.","If you don't, it won't work as it's not compatible.","We do not print that many color pages, but have had to order new ink every 2 months over the last year.","Now just waiting on different paper type from HP to see if different quality of paper may not fix paper issues.","The starter pack of inks were not included.","HP officejet 9015e.","Otherwise you can\u2019t go on and that it\u2019s required  Just press a little?","It is a better printer and it has refillable tanks.","Just for info the problem was not the printer is was with both of our computers.","And I used to be an Epson girl.","So far I'm very impressed and happy with this printer.",").So get this, as soon as I processed the subscription and HP had me locked into buying their toner, my print job printed!","Resets to factory startup every month or so, requiring setup, printing alignment page (expensive HP ink), reconnection to all machines, etc.","I am a 29 y\u002fo male and mostly quick with electronics.","I-replaced  my old ho printer with this.","Wound up going thru process to factory settings & finally cleared error message; printing then commenced.","Overall, I think the printer will be fine for my minimal usage.","Super disappointing with the cost of this printer when I could have gotten a Lexmark for half the price.","I am not exaggerating at all - literally every day and various times through the day had to unplug, restart, etc.","If anyone knows the fix please respond  Id love it if that was fixed.","Spend more money and get a decent printer.","The printer is ok but don\u2019t do the ink through HP!","This was a good printer for the most part.I just had a problem with it and I tried calling the HP support to nit much avail.I really need a printer at home which is making me buy a new one right now.i have also changed the brand ..see how that goes","This is the 2nd time I've had this printer.","I like the automatic document feeder feature and it works well.","Sone have a short life while others have a long life.","But it's really a let down.I haven't printed anything yet.","Simple features take hours to set up each day when I try to print or scan documents.","I originally purchased this printer for my classroom but took it home after I was unable to print using the school network.","I have decided to return.","Load, lot's of updates, disconnects from internet, and being forced to use the app for lot's of things is frustrating.","Really frustrating when companies pull scams like this","He wanted $199 to fix my issue and my printer isn't even a year old yet.","Go figure.Died in less than a year what a piece of crap.","If you're considering a refurbished HP printer, I highly recommend it for the significant savings and included benefits.","Only issue it sometimes just doesn't respond almost  like it falls asleep.","Whenever I was setting up I did have a couple of questions...HP customer service WAS AND STILL ARE always so kind professional and \"patient\" to help...the ink and paper programs can not be beat..","La puedes conecyar a varios dispositivos a la vez e imprimir desde la distancia de forma rapida y precisa.","I really liked that feature and miss it a lot!","Black and white pages were unclear with much of the type not showing.HP agreed today to replace the defective unit and extend the warranty, but the project of getting them to respond to the defect was so time consuming, during weeks of which I was unable to print, I'm pretty unhappy overall.I would definitely NOT order this unit again nor would I recommend it.","After 6 hrs of trying It took Tech Support about 20 min.","If you follow the instructions on the computer, it leads to no solution.","This one does not feel as solid as the previous two HP printers I've owned.","We now have to buy HP ink, which is more expensive.NOT HAPPY.","I mean...how does this happen???","It\u2019s a joke.","I always buy HP printers as they are reasonably priced and do not use a lot of ink.","On sale now and I am using the Amazon 3 pay, no interest.What a good deal!","\"swipe the dashboard.\"","They can lift cartridge easily, but I couldn\u2019t.. so I asked friends\u2026 finally I opened it successfully by lift it at the same time press a small

printer on my laptop or iphone.","I am outside the return window and beyond frustrated.","Easy to set up, scan, print, and copy.","There is no option to order more under the 6 months.","So basically the computer is worthless to me at this point.","This printer is efficient but unfortunately consumes ink quickly.","Previous two HP printers were better suited to scanning.","I then go weeks, or months without use of the printer before it randomly begins working again, only to have the same problem several weeks down the road.I finally gave up on the instant ink and purchased genuine hp ink for the printer, to the tune of $80 or something ridiculous since the error message seemed related to the ink subscription, hoping that I could then at least get it to connect to the internet and function again.","This printer burns through ink cartridges fast!","Don't tell you you can't just plug it in and use it.","I did not catch this earlier because I don't use it that much.........","Printed out the kiddos school pics instead of paying $6383919 through the school.","Quility of printer cheaply made.","It\u2019s totally misleading.","It does it with them even controlling my PC same errors print heads need cleaned and alignment needs to be done.","Im very happy with my purchase, great size, great quality, quick connection easy to use.","the test print said ink jet needs to be cleaned and aligned.","Able to be able to get printer to function on our own.","I see all the negative reviews and I felt the need to leave review and let people know regardless of what the set up tells you you do t have to sign up for hp+ software.","However, the incentive for free ink offered in the advertising is awful.","Your advertising is false.","Cannon has basically the same service, but it uses Alexa to notify you and order a new cartridge.","Cons are the quality of the printer itself is very cheaply made.","I have to register it with HP every time which is a 20 minute journey through their website, not the app.","I bought this for $200 on Amazon Prime Day 2023.","I usually love HP products but I\u2019m disappointed with this printer.","Not sure what you're looking for, but it's not this.You know, it prints, after 20 minutes of work, and a lot of times it's a different issue so it's fun in that way.","It\u2019s still didn\u2019t work.","Individual cartridges for each color come with large plastic caps that have to be removed and discarded.","This printer had caused me much time and unnecessary stress.","bought this to print our wedding stationary and print on envelopes bc it was literally cheaper to buy a $150 printer than pay a printer to do all of that stuff for us (side note on that - weddings are a scam?)","Best of all, you can easily increase or decrease the number of pages you subscribe to.","Difficulty initially to set up the wireless and intermittently have trouble with that.","After trying everything to troubleshoot I reached out to customer support only to find out that I need a USB 2.0 cable, which of course did not come with the machine so now I need to spent even more money and wait for delivery.","I have exceeded my monthly allotment of 10 pages plus 4 rollover pages, so my printer won't work.","When the ink finally arrived too late for the event that I needed it for I installed the cartridges.","But at the same time I'm comfortable with what they're offering.","I used to have a Canon printer which worked great for several years but decided I needed to \"upgrade\" to something newer and thought the reviews looked great for this printer on amazon.","It's a great printer don't get me wrong, but I've ran into some issues with the software.","I believe it is misleading, a scam, and a fraud.","The documentation simply doesn't give you valid instructions.","Repeat until position is correct; more frustration.","Nobody seems to listen.","Ridiculous.","Hopefully HP won't raise prices and make it unattractive, but then I'll just cancel it and buy cartridges and the office superstores.","My issue was never addressed or even offered any extra services for this printer that has dropped on price over 60 dollars total after just 2 days purchase on Amazon who also dropped price when I contacted customer service who said they don't offer price protection and who have to contact hp.","I need to be cleaning the printer heads everyday.","I liked the printer so much that I purchased it again and just plan on not using it for card stock since it's such a good printer and the fact that on the last printer i had already printed over 3000 pages so I'm sure it was at end of life anyway.","Then I noticed another message from my printer, this one telling me that it won't print without authentic HP printer cartridges.","I talked to hp tech support because two sided printing was not working.","HP is also now trying to monopolize ink.","It pulls multiple sheets at once from the tray causing glitches in the printing thereby wasting ink and paper.","Manufacturing of this printer is sparce at best.","Who at HP thought this was a good idea to consume more paper in making copies than used in the original document.","Will change paper and see if that helps.","Finally the scanner we all started to give out, so bought this one to replace get past the set up and these HP all in ones seem to last forever.","Only if you sign up within 7 days of setting up the printer and activate HP+ and create an account with instant ink.","Which is when they will hose me for per page prints.","Quality of machine is cheap, but operates properly - adequate for light use.","The Envy is possibly a better photo printer.I once had to scan 80 pages for a ProPublica article I was contributing to.","The tech called me to help me troubleshoot why the printer wouldn't work (I'm pretty computer savvy, so this should have been easy).","I needed something in a pinch that would suit my needs in this particular printer filled that gap nicely.","I thought this printer looked equivalent to my last however I was wrong.","Honestly, how hard would lit be to have a \"remove\" button under your list of printers, and why did I have to deal with two \"chat\" people and finally resorted to figuring it out myself?","That mini-rant out of the way here's the review.User interface on the product side isn't great.","The Epson lacked an output tray.","HP's ink subscription is a total rip-off.","First it wouldn't communicate well with my PC - on and off whether it would or not.","If you are like me, you have a printer because maybe once a month you have things you need to print.","\u00bb","This printer is you pay for what you get!","Auto copy up to 35 pages with two sided printing.","Once installed, they work fine.","I am extremely frustrated and disappointed that this said dual printing.","For my teacher son who wanted a fast reliable printer.","Other than the fact the Amazon price has dropped $60 since I bought it, the cheap plastic paper tray and guide have to be jiggled as they snag on each other, and when I went online (at HPs suggestion) to get my Chromebox to work with the printer and was advised I'd have to first download an app to my phone to make this happen (not true) while being pressured to sign up for the \"instant ink\" program because if I don't use HP cartridges my printer will stop working (hopefully not true, time will tell...) it's a great product.","I love this printer.","I have 2 heavy-duty laser color printers in my home office, a brother and lexmark, both of which have 5-star print quality and durability.","Me gusto mucho esta impresora","We have a small congregation and we use this printer seldom.","Won't connect to multiple devices.Like a phone or a computer.Keeps telling me HP needs to finish with set up but unfortunately HP smart ap won't recognize the printer.","This is a decent machine.","I am an occasional user, I don't use my printer\u002fscanner every day or even every week.","It\u2019s very efficient","The printer works fine and the cost was resonable, but it took me a day and a half and much frustration before the printer began to work properly.","This printer is very affordable\u2026 And I waited for it to go on sale which made it better for me\u2026 It does everything I need to do.","And I started all over, yet each time, the HP Smart program for the printer interrupted my Wi-Fi, thus the printer could not communicate with my computer and HP, I assume.I searched comments about this issue and found that 90% of them mentioned this issue.","I suspect it has something to do with the smart cartridge.","I really like the instant ink program which manages to always keep me supplied.","Have owned several HP printers over the years but this will be the last one I buy ever.","I have no idea what they are talking about.","I was HP brand loyal but this printer changed my mind.","That is absolutely ridiculous.","It appears as though I can manually update the software when I'm ready without signing up.","It opens up in the browser and depending on what you use as a

controlling or forcing  monthly subscription is horrible.Once you cancel HP truely shut down your printer.","I was excited to get it.","I could not print anything until HP received my next monthly charge.This printer has probably less than 100 pages total in the last 8 months.","It also will not allow us to use the 2nd set that came with the 2nd printer because it recognizes it as a \"setup\" cartridge and forces the refills to be used.","I am very happy with my new printer.","Definitely liked my older printer but this one will serve my purpose.","Found lots of people asking the question about not being able to do this, so the instructions could be better.","This company is a joke.","The printer keeps going off line","And the setup on the HP Smart app would just freeze, or error

by wire, as can\u2019t download proper software.","I had to go through the cleaning and alignment process about 4x before the ink started functioning normally again, which was kind of annoying.I do still highly recommend though, as the price point is great if your not looking for a photo printer!","I'm leaving a few steps out of that story because there were so many minor problems that it would be impossible for you to follow everything.","No response.","I was printing documents about 20 mins after opening the box.","You must use their app, their ink, etc.","The printer will not even work with off brand cartridges.","This is a very poor product.","One more thing, there\u2019s only enough ink in the cartridges that come with it to last about half a week.","I had to talk to two people and finally just figured it out myself.","Ran out of ink ordered ink online and the printer does not work.","It wants to use wi-fi but my old desktop doesn't have wi-fi.","After remoting into my computer, the tech informed me that it was a firewall problem (which it isn't) and tried to sell me a $350 firewall package.","This was the only reason I purchased this printer is price and document feeder!","This printer at $99 is an incredible bargain.","Excellent quality printer","Every time I try to print, they say I am not setup, but I am and have even received ink from them that I do not want.","For $30 more I bought Epson Eco Tank printer.","However, later on could not get my wife\u2019s phone to connect.","My original thought was, free ink for 6 months and a subscription that would send ink when I needed it would be great.","It stopped working and showed me a message to set up my printer.","When it does actually print, it's nice, but I think that's the absolute bare minimum of a printer.","Yet, there is a workaround.","Okay, you get that?","And, they do not overnight the cartridges when one is bad.","Please tell me what\u2019s wrong \ud83d\ude11","Please save your money and do not buy their printers.","No visible signs of defect or damage.","I've used HP since my very first printer, and I believe in brand loyalty when earned.","I can't find a usable work around.","I don't need the stress of subscription time limits with a freaking printer.","Good product but don\u2019t get sucked in to HP instant ink.","I get HP all-in-ones for their quality scanning and to print drafts mostly.","That worked for a little while.","It was easy to setup and way to use.","Really awesome printer!","But you have to download HP smart everywhere.","I'm expecting to have problems with this machine.","BUT  that is only if you have Windows or Apple.","If I had seen the fine print, I would have gotten something else.","Good printer, like the smaller size and print quality.","Images are full of black or white lines.","Works great, easy for me to use and when I need help, which is not often, he has no problem fixing it.","So, my Epsom was old and I couldn't get it supported on my new computer.","And if that wasn't enough on its own, I can not enter more than 1 print job into the que at a time without it sending an error code and stopping halfway through.","I got spoiled with my Envy printer, which I loved.","So, no help screens, nothing.","Have not learned everything about it but so far I really like this printer plus the ink is not as expensive as some others I have had plus I could find the cartridges at one of the giant warehouse clubs for a good price.","The printer arrived with a defect on the paper catcher, but it was workable, so I began using it.","I am amazed, and seriously, HP is truly the best printer out there for the home office.","Fine, that took a bit.","At the end he told me he agreed that the printer is not going to work and wanted to send me a replacement for the replacement.","In contrast, during the four weeks I have owned this HP printer, I have had multiple recurring problems.","Be careful with HP Printers.","Horrible company!","Terrible product.","I didn't bother putting it in quiet mode since it says it slows down the printing speed and honestly it's not that loud to begin with.","So it's good that the job printed fine, but it's weird and annoying that my phone thinks it didn't, and now I have an error notification sitting there, and if I'm not near the printer I don't know whether or not it actually printed or if I need to retry.","I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot but I did expect the printer to perform correctly.","Please advise??????","What shocked me was, when I hooked it up and started to-it was NOT plug 'n' play like the old printers.","Pathetic.I did sign up for the HP+ which is really a spy for firmware upgrades, (we all know how those turn out) and the ink deal as I really only print a few shipping labels a month or a Movie script twice a year.","That is not true.","First I want to note that it works well but features are not any different than much older unit it replaced.","I'm

sound, but it\u2019s not loud !","I was replacing it with an older HP printer that worked fine until my system turned to 5G.","My other HP Envy never went off line and so when my kids needed to print

still says drivers not found even after they are manually installed.Probably an issue with Windows 10 and the HO drivers talking to each other\u2026but HP really drops the ball not having a fix for this.Also, new printers do not have a USB drive port to manually install drivers, and also no Ethernet jack for hardwire connectivity.","!Too bad HP had turned off manual install from printer it self.So I had to tun printer on\u002foff many times to get the install going.","HP will send a notification that  the color ink cartridges in the machine are empty (incompatable with the printer) and

to figure out how to remove my old printer the HP Smart App.","(That's really no one's fault, I'm not even mad at the kids) The process for reordering the cartridges was extremely difficult and it took me a week of trying to get in touch with someone to send me more ink.","Next the tech remoted into my computer and still could not wirelessly connect to my HP tower.","La calidad es excelente y las subscripcion para la tinta y el papel llega rapido y de muy buena calidad.","It won't find the papers, so it won't \"grab\" to print and when canceled, it won't stop trying to print so it wastes ink.","This printer will make you not ever want to purchase an HP printer again.Then after you sign into your account and install the Smart App, you have to log in yet again when you want to scan something.Overall, it took an hour to install and get it running.","Had to call Tech Support.","Update* I discovered how to keep the printer from spitting paper onto the floor so that stops the error message and constant bright light smh.","Still a 3 just bc of the 2 hour hassle, but the printer is great.","Downloading the hp app is required for install.","VOILA, it works correctly now.Thank You HP for wasting hours of my time, blaming apple for your product failure, and leaving me on the hook for a brand new printer that wouldn\u2019t work.","The later versions of this printer were better.","The feed function is great!","I could not get it to print anything but the info screen.","Hopefully not all HP printers are like this.","Also I am approaching 80 years old which is a minor miracle ((not the age but the fact I understood the direction).","Downloaded the latest HP app and all it wanted to do was get me to subscribe to HP+\u2026Maybe time to try a different brand of printer??!","I'm waiting for my photo paper.","They should all Epson about a good scan interface.","When it went out...I finally decided to purchase this one..I was really on the fence about a refurbished...","Please advise asap it will not print.Also send us a return shipping label.","Not bad for an inkjet printer.","I've had this printer for 3 weeks and have been unable to print for 2-1\u002f2 of those weeks because I've been waiting on their \"INSTANT\" ink.I would NOT recommend this printer or HP in general.","I have never owned a printer that has stopped working in under a year.","This one must be powered on before you send a print job to it.","So I\u2019m just warning anyone who has a Mac and have problems connecting this printer try upgrading your software first and don\u2019t pay HP support tax.","It takes FOREVER to load and takes forever to print and makes all these unnecessary obnoxious noises, sometimes for 10 minutes before printing out a single sheet.Also, I signed up for free ink for 6 months upon purchase and had to give my debit card info.","They arrived, I installed them, and for three days they printed fine.","This printer used to work great.","So, maybe I am worrying about nothing.","Say to get hooked up and connected to my local network.","Son insisted I get a laptop (he knows a lot about computers, is border line genius (IQ 140) so picked up a Dell for me.","I ordered this printer in October 2023 to replace the previous HP All in One I had that gave up the ghost in under 2 years.","So, definitely a great 1st time printer.","Finally got it to work and now it works very well.","Hence, the Company was billing us for paper and ink according to how much or how little we used both items.","Everytime the computer is off,  I have to go through the same setvup.","The printer works fine.","I finally got fed up but missed the 30-day return window since the majority of issues started happening about 40 days after purchase.","Amazon support has no one to contact.","Had to straighten out the document and try later.","(I once destroyed the print heads by using bad third party ink).","This is my second same printer.","Installing cartridges was a mess too.","Not everything needs its own app....this is idiotic.","But it still didn\u2019t fix issue, although it did go back to Home Screen.","My only issue is that the thing doesn\u2019t seem to last too long.","I have a toner printer that i have replaced the toner on 3 years ago and it is still running strong!","Sounds good until you find out HP's idea of \"INSTANT\" ink is actually 10 days.","I have looked inside to see if I can see anything on the pathway, but don't see anything.","Second one came from HP and found out it has a speck of a flaw on the automatic document feeder lens that causes a line down the entire page when copying.","You don't get as much ink from the newer ones, but this printer was not made to do the work of the HP 8600.","I\u2019ve been using HP printers for over 20 years and have owned more than 10, but this is by far the worst one I\u2019ve ever had.","Never had to do this with my last one.","IF the printer would connect to the internet, it would have registered that information, however, there is NO way to exit that message screen to get it to connect to the internet again.","I am positive that is what was said, if wrong, someone correct me.THAT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW.","It has built-in security to enhance protection from viruses and malware.","This printer - as is probably all HPs - is a pain in that it forces you to print alignment page every time the power goes off or you change cartridges.","Take a second there and reread that sentence, I'll wait.","Then it told me I had no ink, then it told me I had a new ink cartridge.HP used to be exemplary.","i connected this to my computer wirelessly which seems to be the only option.","Too much hassle and frustration.","My old printer was a b***h to reset after the slightest disconnect.","I will keep my old Officejet 4622 and give this to my grandson.","I bought this printer fir our church office.","Maybe it would connect for 5 minutes tops.","The ink cartridges, which were very easy to replace in my last HP, always get error messages after installation, and it jams regularly.","Oh, but it doesn\u2019t!","Then this happened:1.","I'll be annoyed if they raise the prices though, and I think if they're making you commit upon purchase then they in turn should commit to grandfathering you into the ink prices as of the time of the commitment.~ Several times I've sent a print job from my phone, got an error message on my phone, while the job printed just fine.","You will not get any support.","After that change the printer never works again and HP's service doesn't help.","And, finally it has quit printing at all.","Price & size of printer was what decided my purchase of this printer.","Truly believe Hp purposely causes these mystery printer issues forcing us into another purchase and yet more E-landfill donations.I cant yet say if I would actually purchase this printer again.","But I just couldn't go back to regular printers.","This machine is the worst I have ever seen.Do Not Buy it.","Then 2 months after the warranty expired it came up on my screen that a critical driver needed updated and it would be updating.","Because you can't print anything on it!!!","System threw an error that could not be cleared after 13 months of light use.","First off the quality is terrible.","This was a huge waste of money for a printer that was nothing but troubles entire 7 months.I will never buy another HP printer.","You just have to break it and get something else.Oh, if you stayed this long, I ended up recycling the printer after a few hits with a bat and ripping out any circuit boards I could find.","Printer was in a sealed box that did not appear to have been previously opened.","Bought cheapest cost HP all in one printer to replace the same which is 10 yrs old.","I have only used HP printers in the past and they have lasted for years.","Three things you should know about this printer:(1) It is an excellent printer for medium volume, home use.","I have always bought HP on computers and printers.","A lot of ink lost just trying to get them ready to install.","Tiny horizontal gaps?)","As a bonus, it included a 6-month free HP Instant Ink subscription, providing an additional set of ink cartridges worth another $80.Overall, this refurbished printer purchase proved to be an excellent value for money.","You have to connect to the HP app, sign in to your account and do a complete setup like you just bought the printer.","How much farther from the truth could I get?","Once this machine dries out of my last ink replacement, it is going to the dump and I will find a better printer.","Those days required downloading drivers based on the software to be used.","I am docking the product 2 stars for the terrible software performance and the incessant and slow \"grinding\" the printer feels the need to do all the time.","This printer replaces a Canon I had used at home for years (maybe 15?)","I bought this printer in August of 2023 for home office use.","As long as I use the thicker paper (24lb) it has been great,  but super maddening with the lighter papers.The printer shelf and tray itself feels cheap, but the printer was quite inexpensive,  so...","Also printed using 8.5 X 14\u201d sheets.","HP is obviously trying to make it attractive to switch to a subscription revenue model, even offering printers\u002fink\u002fpaper all for a price per month.","I have owned several Hp printers over the years and have never experienced the  poor customer service or had such a frustrating experience with a printer.","I noticed that the automatic hardware updates was not turned on.","It's so quick and not worth the cost.","It wasn't quick enough to cover the new printer that I had to order, however.","Otherwise, you wait.","This is a good printer for the price.","Dislike that you cannot use a connection between the computer and printer.","For the amount of printing I got out of this unit, it was VERY costly indeed, in terms of both time and money, not to mention aggravation.)","They said they were shutting down the ability to use the ink, but, not using my messed-up brain (chemo brain from cancer) thinking it was shut down and I could use the rest of the ink, printed out more and we were charged $100.REALLY ticked off.","Overall, I would say this printer is a solid one for its price.The paper tray takes some getting used to.","I was told nothing was wrong with my computer or the printer, but my IP address had been compromised and I couldn\u2019t upload the printer.","Some features are a little hard to figure out but with time I think will be a great printer.","The recycling feature of ink cartridges is seamless.","Not.","Plain and simple, if you don't use the ink it dries up.","Bought this printer on June 1, 2023 - March 1, 2024 so I had this printer 7 months.","The printer stopped working after 7 months of very light use.","I decided to keep this printer for home use and ordered a network compatible printer for my classroom.","After no less than 2 days and over 5 hours of conversation between my spouse and me with HP support going through the same troubleshooting steps at least a half dozen times, they finally got that we had a broken printer that they replaced through warranty.","Almost like it goes into some sort of sleep mode.","It is a scam designed to hold you hostage paying a subscription fee every month.","Printing hours after I sent to printer.","Have to get it online.","It is noisy.","I went into the web interface for the printer and setup an admin password and a static IP on it.","But putting docs in the adf it would not print on both sides.","This is my second HP printer.","If I know that I'll be printing more than usual during a particular period, I can increase the number of pages, avoiding extra fees.","We are very happy with this printer and the value was very good.","I have built my own computers on several occasions, have several degrees in linguistics from accredited institutions with a decade of experience, and operate 3D printers on the regular for various needs.","It is also very inconsistent with the printing.","It comes back up on the screen and no way to get rid of it.","My hands were tied due to O.S on this one, not many Win7 compatible printers leftUPDATE Almost a Year owning it and I have not used it Once.","There are some infrequent network glitches.","Ridiculous.","I would recommend receiving credits for replacement ink as opposed to a subscription service.","I have never in my life been so upset with a piece of machinery.","Supposed to be a way to disable it, but it hasn\u2019t worked for me.","It was a major perk to why i bought it","I never received free 6 months of ink","The new printer was so cheaply constructed, I was sure it would break under normal use.","The app is excruciatingly slow already, but then it feels the need to launch my browser and take me to the HP website for all kinds of things that ought to be available at the printer itself, and I cannot believe that the website for a huge company like HP can be so slow and clumsy.","Please save yourself the headache and avoid HP printers all together.","But not so bulky that it's obnoxious.","Perhaps because the setup has the cloud features, it was a bit more complicated to get it running.","I decided to purchase off brand cartridges this time.","Minor issues, as it prints well....and I know you get what you pay for.","I couldn't remove the cartridges unless the printer was on, so I had to track down customer service again for more ink.","I'd spend a bit more and buy a less controlling printer.","Right now I have going on 3 hours trying to get it to print and have only gotten it to print about 10 pages.","Ironically, my other hp printer always ran exclusively on the same mobile hotspot and there is a tower a mile down the road from my call carrier, meaning I always have 5 bars of 5G on my cell service so unstable connection is definitely NOT the issue.At some point, the printer decided to connect using a concoction of multiple cell phones, each with a specific set of bluetooth, mobile hotspot, wifi, and the very stupid hp \"smart\" app.","Yes, i connected to HP+ account and pay for instant ink.","Usually I have to cuss a lot to get one to work.","I dont love it  but its functional.","I got this printer because people always claimed HP had the best printers.","Subsequently, a message appeared on the printer that it was unusable until enrolled in the HP instant ink program.","The ink jets clog, are difficult to clean and never work correctly again, and it printed slow.","For my use it is near perfect!","Then the replacement printer went out as well.","I'm sorry I purchased this.","It's been trouble from day one.","Go figure.Fast forward a few weeks\u2026 it often loses connection with the router (which is just 10 feet away), and is very slow to begin printing after reconnecting.","Little did I know that HP HAS ABSOLUTE DOG-WATER REVIEWS WORLDWIDE FOR THEIR PRINTERS AND THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT HERE ON AMAZON ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.I'd like to point out that I'm no slouch when it comes to technology.","I love my printer.","If you need a printer, this is ok.","I never had this problem before.","My old printer accepted generics (after an initial period of reluctance) and it wasn't all that exciting.","After all that this printer should do the job.","Just need a lot of software improvement.","Why did it have to do it when you wanted to print something?I just bought this model (8015e) because, for the price, these printers are great for home AND office use, AND because I already had 2 brand new sets of ink cartridges stocked up that weren't cheap and I didn't want to just toss them.","Called tech aging they said printer ink jets need to be cleaned.","That lasted for over two hours.","It constantly goes offline, requires endless interaction with the HP printer app, can\u2019t get it to scan, having nothing but hassles and headaches.","WASTE OF SHIPPING, PRINTER AND ALL THE EXTRA INK I BOUGHT!!!","I purchased for business use and it has been a flat out nightmare.","It turns off the direct print feature so I have to keep turning it back on, and I have to repeatedly unplug the printer and plug it back in as it won\u2019t show up on my iPhone print screen.","The money is in the ink, not printer so they're not meant to last.","( that drove me nuts until I thought HMMM I wonder ) AND YUP  I was right  it started working however the going off line thing is a pain.","And the HP Help page is worthless.I just ordered a Canon and this HP will be trashed.And.....I will NEVER buy anything from Hewlett Packard again.","I may have just gotten a bad egg.","Sent it back because it would not print from more than one computer despite 2 days on the phone with tech support.","means  ?","The printer is good.","But it is slow, makes slots of clunking sounds before and after printer, and the ink is a real nuisance and waste of plastic.","Even if you use the upper feed.","When setting up the new printer, they told me to keep the cartridges for the replacement.","Bought this printer.","NOTHING.","Like, there's greed, then there's this.","Stay away!","This new printer is excellent.","This is by far the worst printer or piece of equipment in general I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing.Everything worked fine for a few weeks, but once the ink ran out everything went to hell.","They hope just throw it in closet, or say  well \" the copyer works\" .","I don't have time for this!","It takes you to a Microsoft app.","Overall good printer.","And, though it does not have the paper capacity of my much older and much bigger printer, I find that the amount of paper that I can put into the printer at a time is sufficient...and, most important, as I have grown older, the printer is not heavy.I hope this review helps you.","I have fiddled with it for about 20 minutes on 3 separate occasions and im so over it.","I upgraded from my old HP All-In-One Ink Jet Printer.","This is the third HP printer I owned.","It limits your own ability to use your printer as much as you want.","It was on sale for $99 and the HP replacement print cartridges for $94.","I wouldn't buy another HP OfficeJet printer.","The printer is great!","It is super misleading and I would probably say borderline illegal the way that they portray that you have to sign up for the HP plus software during the set up.","We purchased this particular model to replace a very similar HP printer we had purchased from Costco years ago.","Cool, right?","I'm trying to print a photo of my daughter's dog for a memorial ornament she requested after he died this year and I've spent 4 hours over the past 2 days just trying to print this ONE photo because my $170 printer is, in fact, just a giant, obnoxious paper weight.","Nothing special.","Before tossing a 1mo old printer in the dumpster, I noticed a \u201ccold reset\u201d function in the menu and tried it.","This is a SHELL GAME!WTF?","It is January and will no longer work correctly.","It was so light I couldn't believe it when I opened it.","By contrast this printer was heavy, I'd estimate three times as much, but it is robust.","It has made printing a breeze!","Can't attest to the actual performance until I buy a power cable for it, it should definitely be more clear about the lack of components.","Then the power went out during a storm.","Any time I buy printers I can always count on HP but this 8015e printer is truly the best and you best believe I have tried ALOT of them",".","This printer is far and beyond the series 2700  HP printer we had.","Im not even 6 months into owning this printer and Im already scarred for life with printer PTSD.","I love everything thing about it!","Easy to use.","It is by no means a work horse I hardly ever use it between that and the app that you have to use to use it and it's constant disconnecting and not sending information to get your instant ink and then the customer service I don't even want to go into that, HP you have fallen from Grace","I have refilled my ink cartridges but everytime I do so I have to make sure to avoid some update on the firmware.","They want me to leave it on all the time for updates that sucks up electricity other than that the printer quality is okay.","That\u2019s a whole separate issue!!","The printer worked great for my needs.","Excellent printer, but I also do a lot of scanning.","Not sure about much else yet, but I'll update this in a year.I'd also like to mention the other great feature of these HP printers (the previous two, probably this one too, not sure yet), which is that you don't have to refill the color ink to print in black (or grayscale mode).","In addition, when my two month offer was over, I still had not emptied the initial ink cartridges.","Went through a lot of time, ink & paper to watch it print the same thing !","Easy to use.","I have contacted customer service three times to resolve the issue.Twice I allowed customer service to have access to my computer.","It does everything it is purported to do.","We have three large HP printers and this was just for a short term location that didn't print much.","I have always had an HP printer but still looked at others due to the ink programs that most people did not like.","One is only left, after spending a fruitless repair day, with the buying a new HP OfficeJet 8015e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer.","I think I am going to buy a Canon or Epsom.","It's seamless and one less thing to worry about.","This one...nope!","Bought this when my previous HP printer just wasn't printing well anymore, even after replacing ink cartridges, etc.","Well, HP has significantly stepped up its efforts to monopolize the toner sales now\u2026After my last modestly used HP print\u002fscan\u002ffax device suddenly stopped working (very curiously at that, as the failure seemed more software based than mechanical), I bought this machine as an economical replacement.","The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was advertised 6 months of free ink but it\u2019s a scam.","I purchased this printer to replace a much older HP printer that finally bit the dust after many years of good service.","I did not have any issues with the initial ink cartridges and printing and did not sign up for the ink program.","Also, one cannot use the printer for scanning unless non-empty ink cartridges are loaded.","A month later, the power went out again.","Sadly, this is not an improvement over that machine.","However I'm not looking forward to the cost of ink when the time comes thus 4 stars and not five.","I have never wanted to run over a piece of technology with a truck as much as I do with this printer.","So I threw out the nearly full HP ink cartridges and bought some less expensive ones from Amazon.","I tried using virtual assistant since that's all that is available on the app that needs to be used with this printer and it kept routing me in circles..doing the same thing over and over.","Then, for no apparent reason, the setup finally completed.","They said inkjets needed to be aligned did that.","Was told that my lap top was outdated.","It told me my ink had been updated.","No smears.","I don\u2019t think it will last long.","I have been an HP printer and supporter for over 10 years  This is slowly changing.","It just won't work.","What I find most difficult about HP printers is that they are good only for a short time.The printer works fine for a while then the computer (also an  HP) makes a change with the computer's software or hardware.","I have restarted the laptop and printer multiple times.","So here I am 8 months later, and the printer is still not worth the instant ink charges.","I suppose the printer is adequate for the price, but I have been a bit disappointed in the quality of the print job.","It does not recognize the new ink cartridges.","On the PC side of things, I used the HP Smart App to add a new printer, which it found almost instantly, entered a few settings, and it transferred my WiFi login information, and my instant ink account information to the new printer.","But after logging in and out a couple times, it goes full speed now.","Then they sent me the ink for it anyway even after I told him I was trading it in so now I\u2019ve got an extra ink cartridge and no printer to go with it.","The best part of having this printer\u002fscanner...When you have electric or internet disruptions it automatically resets itself.","No privacy!And her is the BIGGIE!","I ended up buying an Epson and it is awesome - no \"smart app\" required, no connection issues, ZERO problems.","You cannot set it up and get it to print without using HP+ and the app.","Printer worked fine.Then, after the first paper jam, it stopped working.Spent lots of time on phone technical support.It cost me more money trying to fix it, after the first paper jam, than a new printer cost.HP, please make a higher quality printer that is more durable.","must be hooked up wireless.","I used HP Smart for the installation and still had to use HP Print and Scan Doctor to get it to print.","The insane amount of setup of services you don't want or need is an absolute deal killer.","they second the subscription ends your printer no longer works.","The printer takes an extremely long time to get set up.","The aggravation of this printer lets me know I will not buy another HP printer no matter how good a deal it is.","We spent over 50 minutes to get it to work again.I found customer service to be horrible.","I will buy a Lexmark next time and hopefully it will prove to be better technology without the fuss and at significantly lesser cost.","Great printer!","For this reason alone, I may get a different printer.","Bought an Epson for less money and it works just fine.","I called Amazon about the issue.","I bought this HP printer to replace a very similar all-in-one that I use for about 10 years with no problems.","They knew full well that nothing had changed.","Problem started when I hooked it up and attempted to download operating software online (no installation disc provided - common on newer stuff).Went to website - found software - download failed.","This is a low-end printer, but it is INCREDIBLY complicated to set up and it intrudes in asking for WAYYYY too much personal information which should not be required to print and scan.","Printer with no ethenet cord or printer cord or power cord.","It seems to depend on consumers who think problems are their fault, and might want to throw good money after bad.","It does print\u2026 but while it\u2019s printing it sends messages to your phone saying continue or cancel, if you hit continue then it will print again.","I was about to give up hope on HP printers.","I'm putting function over form but I really don't like it.","A postal carrier could never read it.After getting nowhere with HP Support, I decided to launch the HP Smart application that comes with the printer and resides on the computer.","It then showed a screen that I need to go to 123.hp com to complete setup...which takes me to a page that requires downloading hp smart to my phone (it's already there) then the hp smart app gives me setup options for adding a new printer or setting one up that's already connected to the internet.","I am a dedicated HP printer user and have been for 30 years.","When it arrived some kids from the neighborhood had vandalized the package and destroyed the cartridge.","Even then, sometimes it will pick more than 1 sheet at a time or the paper jams or it just has trouble picking up the paper.. Print quality is good and the paper scanner works good......I learned you don't have to power reset it for it to reconnect to the wifi.","I have received the first order of genuine ink but still have the 3rd party cartridge installed.","Constantly \"offline\", disconnecting from my router, not able to find the router or connect to the router; requires installing HP smart app for printer setup, but then repeatedly getting error message on the printer that it was not set up in the HP app (even though it clearly was - but showing \"offline\").","The printer just wasn't cooperating.","If cost is a concern\u2026 Still isn\u2019t a bad printer that\u2019s reasonably priced.","And secondly, the \"HP Smart\" software is SO SLOW!","I'll have to figure out how to make that stop.","You're going to have to download the app, which...whatever, take my metadata.","My old HP printer had the same problem.","It ran out of black ink, so we put in the new ink cartridge that came with the printer and it completely stopped printing in black.","I would definitely recommend using the 6 month ink trial if you print a lot.","This should be easy enough but they find a way to sneak in an update which registers the refill.","But there doesn't seem to be any way to do this.","Two weeks later I turned on the printer and it said setup needed, and there is no IP address in the printer.","I think this is a scam so that you Are defaulted into the AutoShip Inc. program which is nonsense.","I bought this to replace my cannon printer that quit working.","I don\u2019t know how it became uninstalled, but the Smart App and the set up instructions are not working for reinstalling this printer.","After the free trial on ink ran out, there were issues with the printer being disconnected from my internet service.","This is my 3rd or 4th HP printer.","If I do all over again, I would not have bought this printer.","I've had HP printers all my life , the quality has gone to hell.","Eventually everyone will have it and no one will pay for it anymore.","The price of new ink is based on the pages used not on the volume of ink used.","The wireless feature was a HUGE problem.","When HP gets me some drivers for the other features I purchased, they can have the other 2.Hope this helps.","So far I have not had any problem printing from my iPhone or computer.","The Black XL cartridge is 50% of what I paid for eh printer.","Disappointed in the quality of this printer.","I can't believe how much paper and HP ink I've wasted on this ridiculous feature.","Big, ugly, cheap looking and working.","They keep track of everything; send cartridges when ink is low & paper before run out.","I haven't gotten to the end of the trial yet so I don't know if they actually brick your printer if you try to use generic ink, but they were very explicit about you agreeing not to do that when signing up.","Troubleshooting the printer is also frustrating since HP support resources always suggest first that there is an issue with my network (it's never the network) or with my laptop (it's never the laptop).","Symbol and it will tell you that you have to do this to proceed but also ask you if you want to cancel.","People have mentioned something about it making clicking noises when not in use.","Guess what?","Very happy.","since all the \"all-in-one \" drivers are in HP Smart, all the printer will do is print.","There are all sorts of instructions that it does not tell you.","I'm getting a drop of those light horizontal lines, but just a bit, and I bet they could be ironed out if I had time to sit around with settings or something.","The 8020 worked great for a couple years before my cat puked on it and fried the paper jam sensor, which made it think there was a paper jam,  when there wasn't, which completely disabled the printer.I was happy with the 8020 until the cat killed it, but there was one issue I hated about both of the first two models, which was their need to perform 'printer maintenance' sometimes, when you wanted to use them.","The set up was a little tedious but then I reverted to my knowledge of my past HP model.","Done.I have read through a number of the other reviews of this printer that have been posted here.","Hardwired to one of my computers and still have issues.","Waste of time and money, avoid this printer.","When printing chunks of color.","I love the printer being wireless, it scanning capability, its easy if use and the printer tray paper capacity.","It is annoying and seems a bit controlling of HP to not allow the printer to print unless you first sign in.","And I am so tired of having to reconnect the printer to the network!!!","Either nothing happens or it prints and 9\u002f10 times nothing happens.","I don't have a large use for it, so kept it for my small print jobs.","why?","After three weeks or less, we began to receive paper and ink, only to discover that the Company had been tracking our usage of both items.","Scanning is

cancelled the plan after a year and began getting error messages saying the ink cartridges were not recognized (even though HP sent them to me) and the only way to get the printer to work again is to resubscribe or go purchase new cartridges.","We get a notice that now you can only use HP ink and no longer use the off brands, they will no longer work on HP printers.","Yes, with the 3rd party cartridge.","The printer contacts HP when ink is low, and they ship new cartridges free, without any user intervention.","The ink running out very fast and the cost of ink for replacement is what SUCKS.","I like having the Ink come before I need it, it\u2019s very convenient.","I purchased brand new cartridges from the HP store and they cost more than the printer which was very reasonable price.","I've spent an additional $80 on ink, despite still actively paying for instant ink (and having entire, brand new cartridges from instant ink sitting right beside my printer) and this thing won't connect to my perfectly functional internet because it WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A WIFI CONNECTION OPTION.Could not be more frustrated and disappointed in this product.","You run out of ink You got to take out a loan just to buy it.","All processed thru HP app; pick a monthly plan based on average usage\u2026w\u002f rollover for any unused portions & up charge for overages.","We called HP several times and they had us go in the phone circle for over an hour.We had to have a contract for ink, and HP MONITORS what is printed and when.There is not ONE good thing I can say about this machine.For the most part, I have to e-mail my print jobs to my work address, and print it there, or send it to my wifes e-mail and have her print it.","My previous HP printer is so old that they no longer make ink cartridges for it.","If you do, just be prepared for the ink nightmare above.","I tried to take a guess at my printer usage a was I off so without any issue during there trial period I changed my plan.","However, unlike before, the machine literally refused to print, displaying a message to that effect on the screen and stating that it was due to the non-HP cartridge.","The advertising states 6 months of ink... Used printer 7 times and was out of ink.","If your printer says it doesn't recognize your aftermarket ink, shut it off, disconnect the printer completely and turn it back on.","However, I also didn\u2019t want to pay for HP\u2019s toner at twice or triple the cost of competitor\u2019s toner, which worked just as well and seemed to last just as long as the \u201cgenuine\u201d cartridges.","Instead I was challenged that I really was receiving the ink and just trying to get out of paying for it--and after I cancelled the subscription my printer was made unusable by HP with a message on my printer stating \"The indicated cartridges cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP Instant Ink.\"","After 3 months of sporadic use I'm already getting warnings that the magenta and cyan cartridges are running low.","I have no issue with this because I did some math and I believe the instant ink actually is a better deal than even generic ink is.","HP forces you to use their ink products\u2026..otherwise the printer is very good","However, it means that the ink provided as replacement cannot be used because I am no longer subscribed to HP Instant Ink.","Tried half price bargain brand ink after the 3 month free ink HP supplies, but the printer rejected all cartridges, returned for a refund.","I don't trust that HP is going to ship at the point that I actually need the ink, plus it has a fee regardless from what I can tell.","HP controls when and how you purchase ink.Any ink you received as part of the original purchase  is rendered incompatible with the machine if you purchase\u002fbuy any new ink by any means other than the scheme rules of HP.",")over six months for the cost of paper.","I printed out about 20 pages on the starter ink and the Instant Ink sent me replacement ink.","Have had 1 other hp printer for 2 years and the Ink comes before I need it.Signed up for the instant ink program since I already have another hp printer thats enrolled in that program.","If you use the ink you are not permitted to buy third-party ink to replace it, meaning HP will charge you up to $180 to get a full set of ink (XL at Staples).HP requires you to connect to them even if you simply want to scan to computer, the class action suit against them is warranted.","I paid for instant ink for months and everything ran smoothly.Then, for no apparent reason, I'd go to use the printer one day and the touchscreen would just say \"cartridge cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP instant ink\" ...even though the instant ink subscription was still very much current and active.","But beware- the ink does leak when you first remove the orange tabs, so have something underneath to catch any drops.","When I caught the subscription for a product I wasn't receiving I notified HP--thinking they would refund my money for cartridges never received and help me understand how to unenroll from the subscription program.","You sign up for a plan (e.g., I pay $7.41 per month for 100 pages; if I don't use all the pages, they carry over to the next month), HP tracks how many pages you print and your ink reserves, then sends new ink before you run out.","Does not accept non HP ink.","After 19 pages, the replacement toner cartridges were more than the cost of the printer.","Less than 200 copies before 3 of the four cartridges were out of ink.","You either have to pay for the top tier hp printer ink and have their service and agree to all their terms to keep your printer even working.","This company need to let people know that if they cancel Instant Ink and even though you are using original HP ink then the printer still will not work.","I have never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment than I have with this printer - so much so that I am writing a detailed review for the first time in years.Here are the more salient details:-Will not accept ink that is not made by HP which costs about twice as much as other ink.","I declined to create an account with HP, or to enroll in the free ink offer.","If one subscribes, the printer firmware is forever and irrevocably changed so that the printer can only use genuine HP ink.","After 4 weeks ALL ink cartridges are spent.","It would not use the non-genuine cartridge.","You are required to sign up for the monthly HP+ subscription program that includes ink for 6 months (for me) - and paper if you like (rip-off) and are limited to a set number of printouts a month or you are charged extra.","hat the ink the printer came with would last 3 months is totally inaccurate.","A bit of research will reveal HP is being sued over their ink scam and why you should NOT agree to firmware updates when prompted...research I wish I had done.","For some reason my old HP all in one printer has decided (all of a sudden) that the ink cartridge is not compatible.","You have to purchase their expensive ink if you run out.","At about the 5 and a half month point I get an email saying my \"free\" ink period is about to expire, now I have printed about 50 pages over the 6-month period.","And while there is a push by HP to sign up for a regular ink supply, at a monthly fee, you can delay that decision for six months.","I have used secondary market ink on printers for years with no issues, but I haven't tried it on this one.","I went to the HP ink web page and canceled my $5.99 a month subscription ( a week later they sent me an email informing me that the price was increased to $6.99 a month), and that is when I was informed that if I cancel my ink subscription my printer cartridges will be turned off, and now my \"free\" ink is USELESS and my printer will not print until I replace the full ink cartridges, and a new set of cartridges for the printer will cost About $85.00UpdateAfter I replaced all of the ink cartridges, and turned my printer back on again it said it needed to be set up again.","I shouldn't have to buy ink that soon.","If you don\u2019t print you don\u2019t receive any ink.","Purchased HP ink, all good so far.","If my printer gets low on ink, I'll go buy more.","the Machine basically stops working when you try to insert non-HP ink.","Did not know about needing to only use hp ink","Of course it only takes branded ink cartridges so I cannot replace it without paying the full price.","I cancelled the Instant Ink and I have a week to buy ink (even though the cartridges in the printer are about 80% full) because they're going to not let the printer use those cartridges...which in a way doesn't matter since I can't use the printer anyway, but still, very wasteful and insecure of them.Anyway, there's a bunch of other printers out there, so why add extra stress in your life by buying an HP who want you for your Instant Ink subscription and not because they want to bring happiness into your life when you can provide your kids a fun coloring sheet in 1 minute.","We will see how long the second round of ink goes.Good printer, crappy ink.","It rejects anything except an actual HP cartridge.","I received a notification from my HP account that my printer would not work anymore unless I resubscribe to their ink cartridge program.","The e Series locks you into only HP Ink.","Of course, the HP toners are ridiculously expensive.","Just buy your ink on Amazon and many of the third-party inks work just fine the key is when you\u2019re going through the set up on the little touchscreen on the printer and it tells you you have to scan the QR code.","I don't use much color ink.","HP graciously allowed me to change my plan to10 pages a month.","I am already out of yellow ink.","We\u2019ve been very happy with them and with our ink \u201cdeal\u201d we can print as many copies as wanted\u002fneeded.","You'll be paying the highest cost in the marketplace for ink.","And the ink is 150.00 each time I have to replace it.","I put the XL cartridge in there and it has locked down the device saying it won\u2019t print unless I put the same stock type in.","Ordered it in May and have probably used it to print off no more than 50 copies and already can't print because the ink is too low!!!","I tried to load non-HP ink cartridges but it would not work at all.....I could buy a new one instead of ink.","Ordered ink that fits through another company that was budget friendly but HP can detect copy cats and rejects it.","But\u2026 if you refill or install a third party cartridge the printer locks up when it recognizes a non HP cartridge.","If you have problems with a cartridge, you can't just go buy a new HP cartridge - it won't work - you have to wait for a new one to be shipped, so effectively you have no printer.","You positively HAVE to use HP ink, which is so much more expensive than others that should be compatible.","The \"3 months\" of ink included actually turned out to be 19 pages.","To print ANYTHING, you MUST be online...no internet access...no printing!You can't use third party ink...It refuses to print until 'official' HP ink is installed.This morning, it had a complete meltdown and will not connect to the internet...so I can't print.","Feeling screwed, I proceeded to enroll in HP\u2019s \u201cinstant ink\u201d program\u2014under duress\u2014while I decide what to do longer term, as I definitely don\u2019t want another monthly subscription for anything on my credit card (much less for printer toner!!","Price the HP brand ink replacement to make sure this is your best option.","Connecting from certain devices is impossible.Second, more troubling - generic inks which are cheap will NOT work.","I didn't even get 100 pages out of them.I signed up for the instant ink program which sounded like it would save me some money on inks.","When the starter toner ran out, that\u2019s when I discovered that HP was taking things to another level\u2026I popped in the 3rd party cartridge, expecting the machine to chastise me for using \u201cnon-genuine\u201d toner but ultimately letting me proceed.","And, of course, if I want to buy replacement cartridges from HP, it costs nearly as much as the printer did.","I do a lot of printing and I generally am able to get 3 to 4 years usage.","The ink runs out pretty fast.","If I take an extended vacation and won't be using my printer, I can change the plan to the minimum.I bought this printer to replace a five-year-old HP inkjet that worked wonderfully for years but was at the end of its life.","Now I don\u2019t need to go to the Office supply store or order online hoping that they have my cartridge in stock or if the ink will be here on time.","Not HP.-In the past, HP would let you \"disable cartridge protection\" on the printer itself which would allow you to use generic ink brands.","After having this printer for 1 year and being enrolled in the Insta Ink subscription - I've only received one set of replacements.","This may apply to all HP printers, but HP has been on a quest to force those who buy their printers to use \u201cgenuine HP toner.\u201d  In the past, their machines could detect when a \u201cnon HP\u201d cartridge was being used, but this just generated warnings about the quality of

was able to connect my phone and computer.","It was pain to set up the wireless connection.","Wireless and easy to access from your computers and phone.","But since this one is STILL NOT in wifi connection mode (and again, not giving ANY way to do that from the printer) the app can't find the printer, won't connect using wifi direct printing, won't offer me any other options from the app OR the printer screen.So, now it's Christmas.","Did my research and this was one of the printers that does direct wi fi.","This product has a wireless connect to your phone which is perfect!","I tried to set this up on my iPad and got a message that I had to do it on a laptop.","Read reviews and followed the recommendation of first setting it up with my phone the linking my Mac lap top.","This HP printer only has the option to hook up via WiFi, so there is no option for USB or Bluetooth hookup in case the WiFi does not cooperate.","It is not simple to set up the connections w\u002f WiFi, laptop and Samsung phones.","There is not anywhere to plug in a telephone wire.If I had know this, I would not have made this purchase!","The printer refuses to stay connected to any device, making it impossible to print anything of value.","The Wi-Fi was easy to sync with my laptop, something I had been dreading as I am technologically challenged, so I was pleasantly surprised when the set-up went smoothly.","Each time I entered in my Wi-Fi password OR set it to automatically detect it, in the next click for installing, the moment I clicked I noticed my Wi-Fi cut out and it eventually give me an error message that the program \"can't connect to my Wi-Fi network.","Im going to buy the cable and connect it pray that works better but the wireless connection\u002fset up sux!","WiFi randomly becomes disconnected, I have reset it no less than 10 times in the last week.","This printer frequently \"resets\" itself and no longer will attach to the WiFi, even though nothing has changed in the WiFi and all other electronics remain connected.","And to be clear, my router was NOT the problem.","At times I had my mobile hotspot turned off and it would reconnect with no issue at all.","I know it is old, however the irony of this is that the Printer will not recognize my router password due to Network being a WPA2 it only will accept WPA which is as old as my O.S!","The printer goes offline for no apparent reason; scanning is not available; my iPhone cannot find the printer, but my laptop can; printing (when it is working) takes a very long time to happen.","During research to figure out why the printer could not be found by Windows 10, I ran across a note about a 2 hr timer and the need to reset wi-fi setup mode.","If your wifi is weak, you cannot get the printer to work.","This is not a printer - it's a paper and ink holder.The printer won't wirelessly print (which I think is the only way this thing can print since they have a \"no USB\" sticker over the USB port).","Having hard time staying connected to wifi.","They ultimately told me that because my internet connection was a mobile hotspot that it was too unstable to support the printer.","Today again I was on the phone with them, after a few weeks the printer disconnected from the WiFi.","The tech insists that there is a problem with my switch\u002frouter causing the issues.","(It has perfect WiFi signal) It would not do anything so i shut it off and turned it back on, Well it then decided to reset itself so it needed to be setup once again.","See if I need to downgrade my security WPA2 to WPA, give it the Router PWord and then see if the BASIC Driver pkg will be acceptable and then go see if the Win10 Laptop will connect again after down grading the Security on that one too and see if it does not invalidate the code used when generated via Printer Window\u003eSettings and then filled into at driver install.","Every other time I go to use this printer, it erases my wifi info and demands that I setup the printer through the HP app again from square one.","Whenever internet connection is loss, requires you to go through complete setup again.","Then, I got once I got it connect, the printer remained \"offline\".","This printer took me 3 hours to get it to work wirelessly with two computers.","However, if you want to print wifi, then forget it.","It is always offline.","It\u2019s ALWAYS disconnected from WiFi and it\u2019s such a pain to constantly reconnect it.","In the end, she told me that it would not work with 5G band from my internet provider so I would need to get a new router.","I liked there were no disks and it connected to my home wi-fi without the password.","Piece of garbage constantly disconnects from wifi even if it connects at all.","Fairly easy to set up wireless to my home network.","Normally good luck, but this printer has lost Wi-Fi connection 3 times in the last 3 months.","horrible to connect to laptop or phone.","I could not connect this HP printer wirelessly to my HP (3 year old) wireless tower.","I finally got it to enter into into wi-fi setup mode (but I don't know how I did it).","For example, for a device which may require the WPS of the unit, it only briefly comes up when trying to connect.","AND i have lost the hookup status i had to my wifi and it is being a nightmare to get working again.","It goes \"offline\" regularly, prompting me to start the set-up process from scratch each time, which may or may not work, taking way too much time.","You have to reprogram your wifi into it, which is a pain.","The wifi connection is strong, but often times printing from iOS devices just goes into a black hole where the printer never wakes up to print.","Synced well with bluetooth and everything else.","Each time, you have to crack the secret code of button combinations to get past the warning message, so that you can enable wifi again.","I spent hours on the phone with customer service trying to get this printer to print wirelessly.","When I asked the rep how weak signal would cause the printer to lose its IP address, he could not answer the question but insisted that I would need to get up from my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it and walk into the next room to turn on my printer, then walk back to my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it to send the print job to the printer, and again walk back to the printer to retrieve the printed documents from the printer that is nice and comfy snuggled in right next to my Wi-Fi router.Now when I turn my new Brother printer on it says ready to print every time.","Now, imagine putting in a secure wifi password on that bad boy every time you print.I don't print often, this stays at the house, so whatever required links it has to HP probably get severed between prints.","WiFi pw.","Signal constantly needs a reboot.","Wireless connection works great.","It\u2019s not a direct wireless printer \u2014 you have to download the software (HP Smart) on the device to print, and only 5 devices can be connected.","Today it's back to offline, wifi disconnected, I reconnected it and now wants me to do set up all over again with the app and on computer.","Due to Web search and learning WPA info aforementioned and why it will not accept my Router Pword, just gives Error.It does however Print wireless via a short code the Printer offers and then to fill in a blank at driver install time.","It routinely tells me on the screen my WiFi signal is not good, I go into the settings of the printer and it says WiFi signal excellent.","when i tried to hook my laptop and phone to it says i need to agree to a bunch of stuff i won't agree to or the machine won't work.","It loses connection with the printer easily whether hardwired or WiFi.","When I explained to the tech support rep that the printer was WIFI only (no Ethernet port) he suggested that the printer was too far (15 feet) from the router and that it had to be within 10 feet of the router.","Constantly losing wifi connection, poor print quality, and have had to load drivers 2x's.","If it is on wireless and is not used after a certain time, then it will drop off.","I had to watch tutorials in order to do it.Also, they do require you to use their app to use the wireless functionality.","The wifi connection was always spotty and constantly going offline since there was no ethernet port to connect with - though other wifi devices had strong signals.","I wanted it to work with my cell phone but I could not get that to work.","Printer thinks it's connected to my WiFi (yay!","It would connect to the internet, but would not connect to my computer through the wireless network.","I have to restart my printer multiple times per day because it loses Wi-Fi.","It was easy to set up with both wifi and direct line to an old HP desktop.","Hopefully, I won\u2019t experience any problem losing WiFi.","There is USB to laptop from printer port, but the printer should run 100% wireless.Epic waste of time.","The printer has an issue staying connected to my WiFi.","To test it last time, I connected it to a friend's WiFi and had the same issues over the weekend.Save yourself the headache; skip this one.","Once you get WiFi back, it requires you a complete reset up and this can take a lot of time.","For some reason, it \"decided\" that it would no longer connect to my network.","Wi-fi direct printing working well also, very happy overall.","Was very hard to hook up to our phones on wireless.","I was told that the printer would work better if I used a network cable instead of Wi-Fi.","The Wi-Fi part is a little jank other than that it\u2019s really good for the price.","So no Handshake unless I turn my network into WPA and then maybe I can get it on my Network.My other Laptop is Win10 and the drivers installed fine but cannot see it on the Network when looking for Device\u003ePrinter.","The printer wouldn't allow me to set up and connect it to my wifi.","I decided to go with a different brand that can be hooked up via USB if the wireless fails.","All of a sudden, it wouldn't connect to my computer.","It does not connect to wifi most of the time creating lot of stress when need to print something for work","Very difficult to set up, unable to add it to my WIFI so I needed to go buy a cord for it.","This printer connected quickly to my wifi, so no issues there.","I have to unplug and plug to get it back on a perfect connection.","It said it had a poor WiFi connection.","I tried for nearly two hours to set up the printer (touted for it's easy set up) on a brand new Windows 11 HP computer but in the end had to reach out to support because it simply would not find my wireless network with the modem and router not 5 feet away.","The only way this printer works is to be hard connected to the tower with a USB B cable.Unfortunate.","Sometimes the network connection is lost and one must use the Wireless Connection Wizard to choose the network and re-enter the password.",null],"marker":{"opacity":0.5,"size":5},"mode":"markers+text","name":"wifi and

it.","And the front panel seems a bit flimsy, it's not the most important piece but my old Officejet didn't have a front panel that opened and I don't really see the point of this one as you need to lift the top to get inside anyway.- would love to have a paper bypass tray.","Big paper tray.","(DO NOT FORCE OPEN THE LID, OR YOU WILL BREAK IT.)","As a physically disabled person, this is quite beneficial.There are some functionality issues:1 \u2013 the paper tray has a design flaw.","The lever doesn\u2019t move easily that\u2019s located inside at front of tray to secure  paper so it doesn\u2019t pull crooked & cause a jam.","Love the printer the paper tray could have been a little more stable.","Paper tray is really cheap and a little top piece that fits on.","This wont pick up paper unless you shove it in tray and then it frequently pops out.","Works great, when it works.","the plastic housing is very clumsy, hard to open\u002fclose the paper drawer, or open the scanner.","The paper tray easily breaks when removed.","Paper drawer gets stuck when I'm trying to pull it out to add Paper it doesn't slide out out smoothly and sometimes it doesn't open up all the way !","It is hard to get in and out, binding on the sides and just frustrating to use.","It works really well.","Working well.","The pull-out tray to catch the copies and the paper tray are flimsy.","Install the paper.","So if you insert the paper tray, you have to insert it rather slowly or the paper will slide back in the tray and the rollers will not pick up the paper.","One side of the footing of the printer is secure\u002frubber feet?","Any little movement while putting tray back into printer can be frustrating as it often slides back to 8-1\u002f2 x 14 position.","I would take away a half star for the bottom paper tray being sort of cheaply put together and has to be handled carefully when opening and closing.","Functions perfectly!","?, but the other side slides on my desk top so all opening\u002fclosing of the printer paper drawer, etc, causes the whole unit to slide around.","Other than that, it\u2019s great.","Not great though.","In the picture, the top tray is from the 8015e and the bottom tray is from an HP Envy.","It's hard to tell when the tray is in and the tray cover that latches to the top and catches the printed pages is very hard to latch.","Doesn't work well.","Hard to replace the paper tray and the ink cartridges are TOO expensive.","Worked great for a year.","It isn\u2019t easy to set it for 8-1\u002f2 x 11 paper.","However, it does not automatically recognize the size of the paper.","Replacement tray is 70+ bucks.","The plastic paper tray was flimsy and anytime I tried to make a copy, the printer would grab all the paper in the tray and would jam.","When it works, it works.... slowly, but it works.","When using the document feeder, make sure the paper is in the slot between the upper and lower lips.","Then there\u2019s also the outstanding issue of the paper & tray.","As noted, not the greatest, but it does work.(Nov.","It\u2019s been pretty good so far.","I can\u2019t figure out how to adjust it to hold the paper tight.","I have to hold the printer still to open\u002fclose the drawer, and meanwhile fight with the drawer itself to open\u002fclose.","Was told newer series have similar trays; but did say they\u2019re an improvement from the 8000 series.","Besides that works great !","It works real good.","There is a blue lever in the back that can be released, even removed to clear out any residual paper jammed in rollers or tray.3 - error message regarding \u201cink subscription requires activation\u201d; wouldn\u2019t allow use of printer at all.","Just okay .","I'm a fan of HP and I have been for many years.So far so good!I managed to find the paper holder and what a strange area, plus you have to bend the paper to get it in the tray.","paper tray components are not very sturdy & hard to pull out.","Like if you want to print one envelope, it would be great to have a place to just feed that in rather than remove your whole paper stack, change the size in the tray, print your envelope, and then put all the paper back.- like I said before, I'm getting a drop of banding (is that what it's called?","If you want something that just works, this is not for you.","Also hard to open paper tray, it opens slightly and then needs a good hard tug to open it completely.","I was looking for an all round printer and was very disappointed that the paper tray practically needed to be disassembled to change out the paper types.","To put the top of the tray back on, push the buttons, and slide it back on.","It basically works ok. That's all.","It doesn't slide easily.","anyways, super easy to set up on wifi, the tray has those arm things you can move to accommodate different paper sizes.","I seriously didn\u2019t realize it has only one tray that you need to completely empty and readjust to accommodate photo paper.","This is frustrating and inefficient.I can only describe the paper tray as dinky.","Paper tray is very fragil must wiggle to slide in or out.","You'll notice the top tray doesn't have a backstop or tab for 8.5x11 paper.","It's working fine.","In center right of inside tray bottom is a small rectangular button, pushing that down will allow paper tray to slide in for 8-1\u002f2 x 11 to be more secure.","Then pull the paper tray out.","The paper tray and printed outlet tray are very fragile and difficult to align.","I worked great brand new but with time it has issues.","I have another error message stating that the paper tray is open even though it is not.","(Push the buttons on both sides of the top of the computer's paper tray, and pull that off first.","Push the paper tray back in.","Paper tray is very flimsy plastic.","Push down and open the lid.","When I add paper or checks to print, it's hard to get the lid to fit on the paper tray.","Like the printer but paper tray cheap and fragile.","Also, nearly every sheet of paper that comes out, upper left-hand corner is folded forward nearly an inch.","works great.","My old HP had what I thought was only one tray but had a little slide out shelf within it that held the photo paper.","The paper try simply slides out for reload with no button pressing needed.The print quality of this printer is essentially the same as virtually all HP inkjets I have used over the past decade or longer.","The output tray has to be manually extended.","It is a bear to get back on there and you have to do that every time you replace paper.","It has a reasonable size paper tray input and output.","Removing the flimsy cover and paper tray each time, realigning the paper and then pushing them back in the printer was frustrating and a waste of time.","I love that the paper is loaded in the front.","On top of that, parts like the paper tray and the feeder guides feel cheap and are difficult to adjust.","The only thing I don\u2019t like is the paper tray.","Works great !","Tray lid is a little wonky as well.2 \u2013 paper jams paper jams paper jams after paper jams!","I am being told by customer service that I cannot adjust the paper tray so that the paper does not slide backwards for regular sized legal paper.","The paper tray is clunky, so removing it is not a smooth operation like the others.","I would suggest using the eraser end of a pencil or a pen that has not been pushed open for writing (hope that make sense) to push down on the button.","However, even that has a design flaw as it doesn\u2019t lock tray.","Looks like a slider should fit up to paper but it doesn't move.","If you get a paper tray jam and break off one of the legs it won't work.","I can only assume their paper feeders get gummed up with dust pretty fast, and the papers themselves can't be too happy.","Tray that catches printed

bother using the bot chat tech-support.","I googled a number and was finally able to speak with someone.","I was desperate because I wanted to print out my companies statements so I caved in - Yes I was and still feel I was ripped.","Tech assist told me I had Trojan horses blocking download & wanting to sell me software to unblock at cost of $200 - $250.","Neither time was the representative able to solve the problem, and in fact seemed to be more interested in selling me a security program.","He then told me my computer was corrupted so that's why my printer wasn't working  and wanted to sell me software to take care of it and he would run it on my computer for me.","You lost a 30-year customer.","They agree to send me a replacement.","This is what irks me about Amazon.","I turned off the screen sharing immediatly and he had really goofed up my computer on purpose it seems so he could sell me the software.","Imagine buying a car only to find out you're only allowed to buy gas at a specific gas station that sells gas for twice the price.This is just a snippet of my problem with this piece of trash.","Take the time to research other brands that value and support their customers.Additionally, my frustration with Amazon\u2019s declining customer service has prompted me to reconsider my reliance on their platform.","Now by this time there telling me nothing more they can do.","I almost have to wonder if all those cutting in and out of my phone line which was probably over 20 times was nothing more than harassment from this tech on the other end, because I\u2019ve had no trouble with my phone since hanging up from that person.","I then used the tech services over the Internet.","Tech was probably a little frustrated w\u002fme; I figured it out, he didn\u2019t.","Rarely in my life have I experienced such BAD ATTITUDE from any company.After not receiving my previous promised call I called in again.","I am in my 70\u2019s & not tech savvy & my computer is older which of course took longer to load & he was very patient with me.","Bad service equals bad products.","Very hard to solve issues when they keep forgetting what you have already told them.I was promised a call back the next day at 11:00am, it is now 6:20pm the following day and I have still not received said call back.","While on the phone with them they control my PC and they can't even get the software to load.","So much for being a over 15 years of loyalty.","Had several issues where they would ask me for information repeatedly that I had already given them.","I declined and he became very insistent.","The whole time I was on the phone with this clown who I could barely understand, the phone cutting out losing connection with him.","I told him I wasn't interested and I would prefer to take it to someone locally.","they are the best.","I also had a problem with one of their techs when i called for service.","Minutes after I hung up with him, another tech supervisor calls me and tries to sell me the same package.","More than five times he said I had input an incorrect password.","Customer service is awful!","They did not call back this time either.","Even though it is a problem with the mechanics, they will not honor it.You've been warned.","Seriously 2 days later it dropped 50 dollar before taxed and neither company has help resolve this issue.","While I am on her phone,  I asked her to call someone on my phone.","I have used that service since 2018 and am very happy with it.","After MAKING me get a MICROs___t email box.","I expressed my skepticism about receiving that call given their promise to call me back last time and then not doing so.","Not a big deal, but they definitely need to up their App's user-friendliness and have a \"one-stop\" experience for getting customer service.","Of course, I finally try to go to support days after my warranty ended.","He wanted access to my computer to try to figure out what the problem was with the computer so I gave his screen access.","Was promised a 8:00am call the next day.","Troubleshooters are the worst with help.","That woman took control of my computer for around an hour and a half and abruptly said it\u2019s done and disconnected with me.","I did not have any options with Amazon customer service.","Said installation failed due to viruses on my computer (I was running PC Matic but that was not good enough) so next he wanted 1800.00 for norton and 3 years tech support on 3 computers?","He said ok and HUNG UP on me!","Just can't get a real customer service person.","She talked with that person for over 15 minutes with no cut outs.","I was afraid to call because I knew that it will take a long time.","He became very insistent and upset that i wouldn';t let him install it.","Finally went down to 350.00 for 1 year and without buying it - he would not install.","Have spoken to several people in customer service and have found them, in general, to be argumentative.","I have not had to use the tech support so 4 stars given","The way customer service treats their customers is awful.After not being able to print and spending over 50 minutes getting that resolved I now have a new problem.","the help line was suposed to be free but they wanted a lot of money and had to be contract to tale out international viruses, malware,  Thank God for Best buy.","On the second time with a tech I use a phone call.","Be aware there is a scamm connected to customer service that infect your computer when looking for customer service.","The messages were automated, not even a real person and didn\u2019t understand my problem.","He had to take over my computer and fix things.","When calling customer support they immediately wanted to take over my computer to try to find the issue at first I objected and it took three calls before I finally conceive it so I let them go into my computer and they come back and say that my IP address has been compromised.","Worst service I've ever had.","Update: It took persistence to actually get a live customer service human being.","and the horrible customer service where people barley speaking English which makes it hard to explain and understand .","Yes, the support was excellent but it required them to remote into my computer (something I'm always wary of) and a further 90 minutes to get it working.","Not sure about teck support, maybe they could have helped with the cropping issue, I found no help on line , but most of my issues were design flaws and I\u2019d lost all patients to even attempt to get through the AI chat bot to get a real person.","How can I get a refund or exchange?","Service is excellent","When I declined and asked to speak to a manager, I was placed on hold \u2014 only for the call to be disconnected once again.","His rudeness, and beginning unable to answer any of my questions at one of the worst  customer service experiences I\u2019ve been through","Then he questioning if I had selected the incorrect  WiFi.","Then tells me they can fix the problem (that they said couldn't be fixed) for just a one time fee of $90.","They owe me for the time I have wasted on this piece of brand bullying trash!","Once again I am unable to print anything.It is very hard to take customer service reps and their supervisors seriously when they contradict themselves don't listen to you and don't execute on their promises.In general, I think they have a serious attitude problem in customer service.","The customer service person I spoke with eventually resolved this but while I was on hold a child got on the phone and talked about potatoes.","Needed 20 minutes of on line tech help for installation.","Tech support treated me like I was a goldfish.","and they had the same problem, so they decided to access my computer and try to fix the problem from there.","After 2 hours the representative disconnected the call and sent an email stating that the case was closed as if he\u002fshe had resolved the issue.","After about 10 or 15 times of this, asked my wife if I could use her phone and he could call me on that.","I have spent so many hours on separate occasions with their tech support.","What I have found most annoying about customer service is the amount of contradictions in answers, the ARGUMENTATIVE nature of representatives, the lack of listening and comprehending of issues, the TALKING OVER ME and general LACK OF UNDERSTANDING of what is being communicated and attempted REDIRECTION from the questions being asked.","Yesterday I spent 2 hours on a customer service

print quality of the printer is excellent, but the paper tray and paper output tray are  very flimsy (poor quality)","It works well and prints quickly.","I'm not sure if this is fixable and the print quality is still the best I've seen in this price range, but it's a flaw.- the touch screen could be a little more responsive- That's... Really it so far.","But once it was set up, I love the convenience and the print quality is fine for my purposes.","It prints fine, but there are things that arent as nice as the $50 HP  all-in-one that I had previously.","Print quality at normal, produces a blurry print.","The display on the printer is modest, but notices of any printing problems now pop up on my computer screen.Once again I am glad that I went by Amazon's recommendation.","The print is clear and picture quality is very good, with accurate color rendering.","I was always impressed with the print quality, but on several occasions I forgot to switch to a laser on a print job then printed again, only to stare at both sets of docs in excruciating detail to figure out which was which.","Prints fast and well.","The printer works well and prints quickly and of good quality so far.","It's prints good but the overall quality of the printer is kinda of ok.","The print quality is good (based on the three pages I printed so far).","The print quality was very good out of the box, almost laser printer quality.","The print quality is low.","this prints boldly, with great indicators of when the ink is running low and easy access to order more.","Blacks are CRISP and colors are the same, NO smearing at all.","I don't see how you could print anything larger than the standard size paper.So far set up has gone well .I have to finish it up.After awhile I will update my review and let you folks know how it has gone.I love it so far!","While it prints ok (when it prints), I'm not a fan of the overall design.","Although the print quality is an 7 out of 10...","Makes fine copies, for an ink jet, but I am buying new ink, beginning of January \u201824, when I got it end of October.","Color printing is atrociously s-l-o-w","I like everything BUT it took me two hours to get it to print from my laptop and iPhone.","Prints nice quality black and white as I use it","Colors are vibrant!","Overall, the print quality is superb and fast.","Color photos come out far better than expected.","Yes, the print quality is outstanding as was the touch screen and Tech Support, the latter being the reason for an overall 3 star rating.","I appreciate the quality of my copies and the ease it was to install.","Printed great (though photo quality always looks a bit off color-wise to me).","Photos can be printed, but don't expect the best quality or to be able to print a large photo.Does not use up ink fast and allows it to last a long time.","Liked the speed and print quality.","The text is clear and sharp.","I will say however that the color was great.","The print quality and speed are ideal for home use, WHEN it works, but that's only been about 50 percent of the time I've owned it.I was looking forward to using this printer with an instant ink subscription (advertised as being included for a few months for free), as I've used that with past hp printers I've owned.","Print quality isn't the best but fine for most home or small office uses, however I was replacing a 7058e model and it just doesn't stand up to the earlier one.","It is bulky, often the print quality is poor.","It does print well, but annoying trying to get the paper to pick  up!","Prints my cards beautifully.","Quality of printing is excellent so far.","You can definitely multitask w\u002f this printer , in black \u002fwhite or color !","Prints very quickly and at a nice quality, both color and black and white.","Other than that it\u2019s a great size and it prints great.","Printer quality is fine.","Once I do, I'll write a review about print quality.","Hit-and-miss, but all  printers  print color poorly.You have to go on line to set the printer.","Print quality is good, but now-a-days pretty much all printers can \"print\" pretty good quality, so it doesn't set this apart from others.","After getting it going and setup, it prints very well.","The printing is great quality, which is the most important.","The print quality is not very good on this one.","I have not used this printer yet so its performance I cannot say.","The printer prints nice, everything came packaged properly, but it was missing a printer cord and power cord.","The display is nice and bright and everything printed neatly.","Prints well, but set up was difficult.","From an ergonomics standpoint, the monochrome display is bland but the overall appearance is very simple and aesthetically pleasing.","Great product- so EASY to install and printing has been easy and without issue.","I like the color printing with this printer for personal photos.I'm disappointed with the slowness of the printing action , or the way the paper tray is set up.I haven't tried all the functions yet.","This printer doesn't print any better or worse or faster or slower than any other printer out there.The rather pricey color in cartridges are terrible.","Ink quality is excellent.","The print quality is fine.","The prints appear slightly faded in color and slightly blurry.",null],"marker":{"opacity":0.5,"size":5},"mode":"markers+text","name":"quality","text":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","quality"],"textfont":{"size":12},"x":[10.448531150817871,10.877839088439941,10.482285499572754,10.291690826416016,10.519185066223145,10.059901237487793,10.51405143737793,10.87858772277832,10.572945594787598,10.539589881896973,10.48133373260498,10.537887573242188,10.442534446716309,10.463204383850098,10.326218605041504,10.641938209533691,10.574019432067871,10.525751113891602,10.602011680603027,10.544651985168457,10.559752464294434,10.502705574035645,10.484315872192383,10.29955005645752,10.46940803527832,10.5223388671875,10.497315406799316,10.654664993286133,10.510833740234375,10.8648099899292,10.465129852294922,10.516878128051758,10.539789199829102,10.148594856262207,10.547273635864258,10.436924934387207,10.538752555847168,10.863154411315918,10.559248924255371,10.796308517456055,10.52950668334961,10.47321605682373,10.578393936157227,10.559088706970215,10.37120532989502,10.574579238891602,10.871424674987793,10.278925895690918,10.485722541809082,10.48888874053955,10.552769660949707,10.340733528137207,10.56567668914795,10.389083862304688,10.4810152053833,10.417563438415527,10.477924346923828,10.582660675048828,10.514748573303223,10.534072875976562,10.555898666381836,10.632668495178223,10.63975715637207,10.439505577087402,10.419445037841797,10.572447776794434,10.5165376663208,10.508666038513184,10.403122901916504,10.486505508422852,10.544411659240723,10.505805015563965,10.607688903808594,10.721854209899902,10.523289680480957],"y":[-5.173078536987305,-4.8094401359558105,-5.174684524536133,-4.573380470275879,-4.822648525238037,-4.151826858520508,-5.300763130187988,-4.803136348724365,-5.2450714111328125,-4.710231781005859,-5.217401504516602,-5.239937782287598,-4.634792327880859,-5.203505039215088,-4.395876884460449,-5.141732215881348,-5.1496710777282715,-4.783811092376709,-5.192420959472656,-5.0398664474487305,-5.24505090713501,-5.237338542938232,-4.41174840927124,-4.462380409240723,-4.964885234832764,-5.274083137512207,-5.278374671936035,-5.148830890655518,-4.721388339996338,-4.824854373931885,-4.726361274719238,-4.859724998474121,-5.500704765319824,-4.982974529266357,-4.441982746124268,-4.3144025802612305,-4.8842878341674805,-4.808472633361816,-5.260746955871582,-4.781869888305664,-5.2608842849731445,-4.694402694702148,-5.27617073059082,-4.63352108001709,-4.6859846115112305,-5.271954536437988,-4.810389995574951,-4.796362400054932,-5.264317512512207,-5.065919399261475,-4.8813796043396,-4.487877368927002,-5.296209335327148,-4.611605644226074,-4.570425510406494,-5.09369421005249,-5.304104804992676,-5.3042097091674805,-4.537230014801025,-5.256392478942871,-4.830142974853516,-5.351212024688721,-5.214309215545654,-4.341416358947754,-4.559077262878418,-5.218742847442627,-4.844141960144043,-5.099207878112793,-4.670092582702637,-4.646052360534668,-4.615903377532959,-5.330787181854248,-5.32772970199585,-5.038811683654785,-4.933573246002197],"type":"scattergl"},{"hoverinfo":"text","hovertext":["This

different ink cartridges at the store that were not the instant ink brand even though these were the almost completely full cartridges that came with the printer.Since I reenrolled and paid the

own.","Purchased in June 2023 and as of September 2024 it is in the trash.","Died 2 months after the warranty ran out.","Then, it just suddenly died.","Then all over again.","Have not had this junk not even a month.","After about half a year they replaced one for me because they couldn\u2019t get it connected to the WiFi.","Throw your $100 straight in the trash, you will be much happier than having bought this printer and wasted 48 hours trying to get it to work only to then buy a different printer.","I got the problem taken care of and will not be returning the printer.","I may end up returning this item if I can't get more comfortable with it.","I would like to return this product for credit under the warranty, as the document feeder doesn\u2019t work properly.","As I had thrown away the packing box it was not returnable, so it was thrown in the trash.","I wish I could return it, but that isn't allowed either.","We would like to return this printer and get a refund.","Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t using it much so didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until after the return date.","I\u2019ve have had this for half a year and I\u2019d throw it away at this point.","This printer is useless to me now.","I want to throw it outside and beat it repeatedly with a bat.","The design for this part of the printer is defective.","This printer is a huge disappointment and I will be returning it.","Hated it, sent it back!","Just spins and spins and does nothing will not buy it again.","If my husband hasn't burned the manufacturers box it came in already I would have requested a return.","The original one from Costco worked great for many years.","Unfortunately I can no longer return the printer but hopefully I can save someone else the headache and annoyance of this shady product and brand.","I threw away in two months because it wasn't work properly.And bought another one through Amazon.","!Too much trouble return it, so keeping it.","Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MATERIAL.","It finally died, so I got this one.","I wish I could return it!!","I hate this printer and will be throwing it in the trash.","I wish I could return it or exchange it for a different model.","It still works, but I will be so happy to replace it with a different brand!","Stops working less then a year after buying it","Stopped working after 8 months of use.","Very disappointed in this and wish I could return it.","And, there was nothing really to do except take it to recycling center and look for a new one.","We bought it Sept 2024 and by Dec 2024 it has 100% stopped working!","All i can do is by a new one out of my own pocket.","Honestly, I'm probably going to box it up and return it.","BOTTOM LINE: After talking to \"support\", I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to just shell out the cash for a better printer or just not to get a printer in the first place.While this printer was easy to set up, it is a piece of junk.","I had it for a year now, and it worked a few times but has recently stopped working.","ZERO resolution to this ridiculous situation rendering my printer useless.","Is it too late to ask for a refund or something lmao is mine defective?","I would like to return it, unfortunately it's been too long.","I am considering throwing it away and buying a

buying a seperate scanner.","The scanner feed for multiple pages always produces crooked print copies or scanned documents.","The highest resolution it scans at is 300dpi.","The unit does not do two-sided copies does not stay in sync if you do more than five pages good luck it'll print the wrong side get confused first two will come out good that's it it can't do more than two pages at a time","Which sucks if you're scanning multiple pages.Next biggest pain point is that the cartridges dry out in like a month and a 1\u002f2.","However, i also bought this with the intent to scan documents for e-copies.","Sometimes when a Save is done for a scan the software hangs.","DisappointinAlso, i asked for help as i needed some assistance for the scanning.","I also scan a lot of documents and that's been pretty great too.","I haven't had a scanner in over a decade, but back then, there were options for scanning at MUCH higher resolution for artwork.","I recently had to scan 28 pages and was able to send them through the feed function with no issues!","I am somewhat disastified with HP as I could not figure out how to scan multiple sheets and when I contacted HP for support they did nothing to help me.","The guy had me put a sheet in the scanner, copy it, then open the scanner flip page over and then it printed on the other side.","It doesn\u2019t scan half the

is an office jet printer, so it should be able to do two sided to two sided prints.","I've worked with thus for hours and still can't get to send scans to computer.","For double sided scanning it requires you to use the app to rearrange the page order after separately scanning both sides of your documents, but it's still easier than scanning one page at a time.","Very complicated to use in scanning pdfs.i cannot say i am impressed so far.","You would think scan both sides is a standard feature on all in one printers now days, but no, here I am flipping pages like it\u2019s 1999!!","The product description doesn't really make that clear and if you assume that because it will doc feed a copy, it will also doc feed a scan (like I did)...it won't.","Main pain point is the double sided scanning, which you do have to manually flip over each page just to scan both sides.","Also know that while there is a document feeder that will copy multiple pages, it will not scan that way.","The scanning app is middling at best.","If you want o be able to scan more than one page at a time, do t waste your time with this product.","Also,  don\u2019t like always having to go to the app or my laptop when I do a scan instead of saving to a thumb drive.","I am shocked that a printer\u002fscanner in 2024 doesn\u2019t do double-sided scanning automatically.","Does dbl sided print","You can turn on two sided printing and all that does is when it prints it will turn the paper over for you which doesn\u2019t help because you have to turn it back over to put it back in the paper feeder to do the other side, two sided prints have to be done manually.","I have a lot of papers to scan them into my PC's back up HD.","I am pretty computer savvy but trying to get this to scan and or print envelopes was a nightmare.","The duplex function is useless: When trying to use the scanner to reproduce a document with double sided print, it will scan both sides but the copies or scans it produces are single sided.... why?","The scan function scans sheets angled, I tried to correct it but it continued to scan angles.","I thought I could use a flash drive to save my scanned docs and images, etc.!","Then it wouldn't scan.","Also you can not scan more than 6 pages at a time","However, if you have a Mac -the scanning feature is currently not supported.","It will not scan from the document feeder.","The only way to get a perfectly aligned copy or scanned document is to manually place the document on the glass and scan each page individually (what a hassle!).","The scanning feeder makes scanning in multiple pages at once very easy.","It only will make your single documents into one page front and back.","This unit doesn't do duplex scanning.","Also, no matter how well-aligned you feed the document into the feeder rack, when you scan it, the scan comes out crooked.","So Auto 2 sided printing does not really work on this printer.","The scanner is the most frustrating part of this printer.","If you don't keep an active scan up, it will time out immediately, and then when you try to scan again, it'll scan a blank page and leave your document sitting on the tray, so you have
