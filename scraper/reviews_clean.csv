0,1,Terrible,I've had my printer for a year. It stopped working and showed me a message to set up my printer. Obviously i had done this since i was using it for a year. I tried using virtual assistant since that's all that is available on the app that needs to be used with this printer and it kept routing me in circles..doing the same thing over and over. It was not helpful. I googled a number and was finally able to speak with someone. He told me the driver was outdated and they could do a remote install but it would cost me almost 300 dollars and that would ensure that the printer would automatically get updates when drivers needed updated. I was shocked and said that seems steep..idk if I even paid that much fpr the printer. He said ok and HUNG UP on me! This printer is useless to me now. It won't work without me doing this expensive update.
1,1,Instant ink is a JOKE,I will never purchase another HP product again.  I run 9 HP commercial printers at my shop so i decided to get one for my home.  I ASSUMMED (my fault) that if i didn't want the instant ink auto delivered that i could just buy ink as needed.  I was wrong. they second the subscription ends your printer no longer works.  the subscription is 13.99/month!  NO THANKS no more HP for me or my business!
2,1,Avoid,The printer itself is decent. HP promotes their InstaInk subscription for $7.99 a month and they claim they will send you new cartridges if the printer senses it's running out of ink. After having this printer for 1 year and being enrolled in the Insta Ink subscription - I've only received one set of replacements.  I decided to go ahead and cancel it seeing as I don't use the printer enough to need often shipments of ink refills. The cost out weighs the benefit for me. But now my ink cartridges cannot be used unless enrolled in the subscription and I'll have to pay for refills from elsewhere. I've paid almost $100.00 over this year for the subscription but now can not use the ink I've paid for....  Ridiculous.
3,1,a bit suspicious of the 3 month ink supply,"I've had a series of errors with the printer which are hopefully resolved.  Yet the claim of 3 months of ink is a joke.  I don't print much about 1 page a day and their simple b&w with a trace of color.  After 4 weeks ALL ink cartridges are spent.  All at the same time, now I need to spend the price of the printer on new ink.  Either a coincidence or a scam."
4,1,"If you want to waste time, buy this one!","This printer frequently ""resets"" itself and no longer will attach to the WiFi, even though nothing has changed in the WiFi and all other electronics remain connected. Troubleshooters are the worst with help.  (No, it does not help that the English is unclear.)Though it's under warranty for 6 months, HP won't do anything because they can get it to reconnect for a *few days.  To test it last time, I connected it to a friend's WiFi and had the same issues over the weekend.Save yourself the headache; skip this one. Off to Costco to purchase a non-HP, where a warranty means something."
5,1,Do not get bamboozled into HP Instant Ink,"After the free trial on ink ran out, there were issues with the printer being disconnected from my internet service.  Subsequently, a message appeared on the printer that it was unusable until enrolled in the HP instant ink program.  It was enrolled, in fact, I had just increased my page allowance for the third month after the initial free months.  I sent emails, no response, so I boxed up the printer, cancelled my account, and went shopping.  Now I am using a hassle-free printer with no problems or page limits.  Congrats, HP.  You lost a 30-year customer."
6,1,Burns up ink like no other,"I really hate this printer. I had an HP printer previously that I loved, but the rollers were getting worn out so it was time to replace it. This printer burns through ink cartridges fast!  Granted I do print a lot of things on a daily basis, but the big issue is you have to use the HP refills which are expensive, and I am having to replace them once a month. My last HP I could use the refurbished ones that were WAY cheaper and lasted WAY longer. This one...nope! It rejects anything except an actual HP cartridge.  It also spends a ton of time doing lots of resetting noisy things before it wants to print, not to mention that it doesn't really like to stay online and scan when you need it to. It still works, but I will be so happy to replace it with a different brand! No one deserves to be stuck with this expensive maintenance POS so I will happily throw it on the ground to break it and toss it in the trash."
7,1,Horrible,"Terrible product. It takes FOREVER to load and takes forever to print and makes all these unnecessary obnoxious noises, sometimes for 10 minutes before printing out a single sheet.Also, I signed up for free ink for 6 months upon purchase and had to give my debit card info. I lost my debit card and didn’t update it so they couldn’t charge me after 6 months. I forgot to cancel it sure, but it’s not that big of a deal.However, I tried to scan my own ID at home for something I needed right away, and the printer displays a message saying that there is a problem with my HP account and I cannot use my printer until I resolve it!! That is absolute TRASH! HP should NOT have that much power over my own printer over the instant ink. That’s a whole separate issue!! Infuriating is an understatement.Then when I went to my account to cancel the instant ink, my printer still wouldn’t work.When I tried to use support. The messages were automated, not even a real person and didn’t understand my problem. I hate this printer and will be throwing it in the trash. I’ve always had HP products but will NEVER again."
8,1,Don't buy,"I was HP brand loyal but this printer changed my mind.  We have three large HP printers and this was just for a short term location that didn't print much.  What a waste of time and money.  Purchased in June 2023 and as of September 2024 it is in the trash.  Constant problems with this printer.  And, finally it has quit printing at all.  Did all the diagnostics recommended and nothing.  Bought an Epson for less money and it works just fine.  HP's ink subscription is a total rip-off.  If you have problems with a cartridge, you can't just go buy a new HP cartridge - it won't work - you have to wait for a new one to be shipped, so effectively you have no printer.  And, they do not overnight the cartridges when one is bad."
9,1,wastes ink and paper with constant need for alignment,"This printer - as is probably all HPs - is a pain in that it forces you to print alignment page every time the power goes off or you change cartridges.  I can't find a usable work around.  Of course, I finally try to go to support days after my warranty ended.  If you get this, make sure you TRY to get through to support (that's a whole 'nother process) and see if they can tell you a work around.  I can't believe how much paper and HP ink I've wasted on this ridiculous feature."
10,1,Good replacement printer,"I am very pleased with this printer. I did a lot of research to pick a new printer and the reviews about the ink program was concerning.  As I was researching, I found most printers have the same program. I have always had an HP printer but still looked at others due to the ink programs that most people did not like. I received the printer the day after ordering and found it easy to set up. I did not have any issues with the initial ink cartridges and printing and did not sign up for the ink program. I did some printing and did not have any issues like some people stated with it not printing due to the ink program. It's definitely lighter than my last HP printer but that is not a concern for me as long as it performs. I would recommend this printer.Updated 6/29/24After having this printer for some time, I am now having buyers regret. It is not made as well as my last HP and I continuously have issues with it. Also if you don’t print a lot the ink gets dry and you have to run the alignment program numerous times. Never had to do this with my last one. Also,  don’t like always having to go to the app or my laptop when I do a scan instead of saving to a thumb drive. It is also very inconsistent with the printing. I do not recommend this printer."
11,1,One star because 0 was not an option. Under NO Circumstances purchase the HP Instant Ink Plan!!!,It is a scam designed to hold you hostage paying a subscription fee every month.  I cancelled the plan after a year and began getting error messages saying the ink cartridges were not recognized (even though HP sent them to me) and the only way to get the printer to work again is to resubscribe or go purchase new cartridges.  Get an Epson.
12,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"I usually don't write a bad review unless the product is just terrible in every way possible, and so it is with tis printer. Looks like a high class printer, but functions like a piece of junk. If it is on wireless and is not used after a certain time, then it will drop off. You will have to power reset the printer for it to reconnect.Secondly the paper tray is a design flaw even though HP will say it's not. In the picture, the top tray is from the 8015e and the bottom tray is from an HP Envy. You'll notice the top tray doesn't have a backstop or tab for 8.5x11 paper. So if you insert the paper tray, you have to insert it rather slowly or the paper will slide back in the tray and the rollers will not pick up the paper. Even then, sometimes it will pick more than 1 sheet at a time or the paper jams or it just has trouble picking up the paper.. Print quality is good and the paper scanner works good......I learned you don't have to power reset it for it to reconnect to the wifi. However you still have to press the power button. Almost like it goes into some sort of sleep mode."
13,1,Junk,"I’ve had this printer for less than a year, using it a few times a week, and it’s going in the trash tonight. It’s been wonky since set up. It’s ALWAYS disconnected from WiFi and it’s such a pain to constantly reconnect it. Now the HP app is telling me that the printer is not set up and won’t print. I went through all of the troubleshooting, reinstalled the drivers, etc and nothing fixed the issue. It will say “ready” and then as soon as I hit print it’s back to “setup incomplete”. It’s not worth the headache. I ordered a $75 Brother instead and it’s been much better already. Don’t waste your money."
14,1,Worst company ever,At first I had an instant ink account but I was wasting pages so I cancelled . They only rollover a certain number of pages and if you dont use them they are gone.  This company need to let people know that if they cancel Instant Ink and even though you are using original HP ink then the printer still will not work.
15,1,If you want the ability to scan DON’T buy,"This printer function works great, however if you have a Mac you have to do your scanning from the HP app.  This would be fine if it worked, but instead it worked the first time and after that no matter what I do ( resetting the printer:scanner, deleting and setting up again, etc..). It will not scan from the document feeder.  If you want o be able to scan more than one page at a time, do t waste your time with this product."
16,1,AirPrint didn’t really work,"I purchased this printer to replace an older HP printer solely to serve as an “AirPrint” printer. The print was very slow, approximately 2pg in 3.5minutes, and 30sec into the job it would generate an error popup that would lockup the iPad or iPhone. The older HP would AirPrint the same document in less than 15sec with no issues. I spent hours with HP support, who finally insisted it was an Apple issue…even though my other HP printer would AirPrint fine. After years of purchasing HP products, I couldn’t believe how they were blaming apple when it clearly wasn’t an apple issue. Before tossing a 1mo old printer in the dumpster, I noticed a “cold reset” function in the menu and tried it. VOILA, it works correctly now.Thank You HP for wasting hours of my time, blaming apple for your product failure, and leaving me on the hook for a brand new printer that wouldn’t work. Last HP product our family will ever purchase!!!"
17,1,Scanner?,"What a piece of junk, printer connects but the scanner doesn't! Spent a day trying to connect using their on line links but nothing worked. The Canon I replaced works better . Like most of these mfg's there's no longer a live body to talk to. The on line chat was useless as well. I've used nothing but HP laptops for as long as I can remember and have always had good luck. Truth in savagery, it's entirely possible I did something wrong during the installation, but was never able to get it right."
18,1,Lasted less than a year: Warning Subscription cartridges will on work with active subscription,"I wanted to like it and actually enjoyed the cartridge subscription, but when we changed internet providers, we never could get it reconnected to the internet, so it would not print because it couldn't synch up with the subscription. I canceled the subscription and was told I would have to buy non-subscription cartridges even though I had plenty of ink left in the subscription ones. Still could not get it to connect with our printers, and it doesn't have a direct USB to bypass connection issues.  I'm now replacing it with a different brand."
19,1,Replacement Ink,Bought this printer and it came with a subscription to get ink sent to when it read low… long story short… you get ink cheaper but they want to charge to print after only 10 pages. Ordered ink that fits through another company that was budget friendly but HP can detect copy cats and rejects it. Way too invasive for me. Ridiculous
20,1,Do not buy!  Disconnects every time power fluctuates.  Will not print.,"At first, I liked this printer.  It seemed to work well for scanning and occasional color printing which is what I use it for.  Then the power went out during a storm.  I had to uninstall and reinstall everything to get it to work.  A month later, the power went out again.  I tried to uninstall/reinstall and the printer just keeps saying that it needs me to finish the setup.  But there doesn't seem to be any way to do this.  I cannot recommend this item."
21,1,After 1 year,This product has completely failed. Won't connect to multiple devices.Like a phone or a computer.Keeps telling me HP needs to finish with set up but unfortunately HP smart ap won't recognize the printer. Even if the computer itself says it's available.Longevity sucks. We have chosen to try a different brand. After using only HP printers for the last 10yrs.
22,1,HP will do everything to squeeze money from you,"MASSIVE BUYER BEWARE!!! I cancelled my subscription to their 'service' because I didn't want to have to literally count how many items I was printing each month. No joke, if you select a certain plan under them and print over it, it'll cost you more money to use your own printer. The ink cartridges I purchased after cancelling are now being labeled as counterfeit by my printer and it's refusing to print. Do not buy this printer. I'll be purchasing a new printer shortly and will NEVER go with HP again."
23,1,You never stop paying!,"If you don't print much this printer is not for you because you have to have a monthly subscription for paper. And I am so tired of having to reconnect the printer to the network!!! When I need to print, I can't print and have to go through too many steps to get it working again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRINTER"
24,1,"Price Trap, horrible product","Plain and simple, if you don't use the ink it dries up.  If you use the ink you are not permitted to buy third-party ink to replace it, meaning HP will charge you up to $180 to get a full set of ink (XL at Staples).HP requires you to connect to them even if you simply want to scan to computer, the class action suit against them is warranted.  I will be giving this printer away and buying something from Brother."
25,1,Printhead issue,Printhead issue only 4 months after purchasing. I used HP ink and regular print paper. I have never owned a printer that has stopped working in under a year. The printhead is malfunctioning just four months after purchase. I used HP ink and standard print paper. This is the first time I've had a printer stop working in under a year.
26,1,Terrible experience - avoid this one,"We purchased this particular model to replace a very similar HP printer we had purchased from Costco years ago. The original one from Costco worked great for many years. This one from amazon on the other hand has been nothing but a constant let down. It constantly goes offline, requires endless interaction with the HP printer app, can’t get it to scan, having nothing but hassles and headaches. It won’t even reboot easily. If I could give this 0 stars, it would still be too generous."
27,1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,We bought this printer to replace one that died. We bought it Sept 2024 and by Dec 2024 it has 100% stopped working! Amazon will now take it back and directs me to HP. HP basically tells me too bad and keeps passing me around like a hot potato. Our office has ALWAYS used HP products. Not after this BS.:-(
28,1,Paper Tray Keeps miss feeding causing jams,"Purchased this printer to use for my boys homeschooling. Set up was ok. Printed test page.. after that.. NOTHING printed. NOTHING. Every single time.. paper jam, ""please check printer and remove jam"" over and over and over.. I cleared the jams ever single time.. and the next sheet would jam. Tried different paper, same result. This is absolute garbage."
29,1,Zero stars???,"horrible to connect to laptop or phone.  every time i try to print i get a popup that says i'm not connected then seconds later it prints.  every time i try to use the buttons on the machine itself says i need to use the app on the laptop.  when i tried to hook my laptop and phone to it says i need to agree to a bunch of stuff i won't agree to or the machine won't work.  made me open an account with hp just to scan then it only lets me scan using the app on the laptop instead of the stupid button ON THE PRINTER!!!!  omfg.  I HATE HP!!!  RETURNING!  WASTE OF SHIPPING, PRINTER AND ALL THE EXTRA INK I BOUGHT!!!!"
30,1,NOT WORTH Instaink charges.  Second review.,"So here I am 8 months later, and the printer is still not worth the instant ink charges.  Just so you know that in the last 8 months, I had to replace the yellow cartridge from the initial cartridges which are not full cartridges. I paid a total of $45.22 for my insta ink account. Why I only have 4 rollover pages in 8 moths, I don't know? .  HP graciously allowed me to change my plan to10 pages a month.  Most of my printing is to PDF so that I have a copy. Today, I need to print a couple of pages for tax purposes. I printed 14 pages in the last 5 days.  I have exceeded my monthly allotment of 10 pages plus 4 rollover pages, so my printer won't work. Instead of offering an additional charge.  I could not print anything until HP received my next monthly charge.This printer has probably less than 100 pages total in the last 8 months.  I will throw it in the trash because I can't use it when I need it.Just for the record, I have used HP printers exclusively for over 20 years.  I ordered a Cannon printer today. Cannon has basically the same service, but it uses Alexa to notify you and order a new cartridge.  You pay for what you receive."
31,1,Not easy setup,"Don't believe the claim that this printer (HP Office Jet 8015e) has easy setup.  I find it hard to believe this is the best selling printer based upon my 5 hrs of reading and searching just to get the printer to be able to print a page.  I suspect my poor setup experience stems from the fact that I waited more than 2 hrs after doing the print alignment until I began to ATTEMPT to install the HP software.  During research to figure out why the printer could not be found by Windows 10, I ran across a note about a 2 hr timer and the need to reset wi-fi setup mode.  The documentation simply doesn't give you valid instructions. It is generic instructions that instruct you to press buttons that the 8015e does not even have.  I finally got it to enter into into wi-fi setup mode (but I don't know how I did it).  The print quality is good (based on the three pages I printed so far).  But the setup compares to a 1000 piece puzzle.  Obviously many people have good luck with the setup, but I was surely not one of the lucky ones."
32,1,No vale la pena,La tinta no la use ni un mes y no sirvió. Y elCosto de la tinta es casi igual al valor de la impresora. Lamentablemente yo no la abrí en cuanto la compré y cuando la usé ya había pasado el tiempo de devolución pero no gasten su dinero en esto.
33,1,Warning - DO NOT BUY,"Be prepared to be ripped off if you buy this.  Piece of garbage constantly disconnects from wifi even if it connects at all. I have tried on two different computers and my phone.  I am not exaggerating at all - literally every day and various times through the day had to unplug, restart, etc.  Maybe it would connect for 5 minutes tops.  Then all over again.  I don't think this is an accident. I purchased for business use and it has been a flat out nightmare.  Hoping to saving someone money and a headache."
34,1,Awful intrusive setup,"The software to set this scanner/printer up is awful. It requires you to install a bunch of software to access the scanner capabilities.Secondary, you have to create an HP account to use it.Then, it toggles back and forth to a browser, then the HP smart app. This printer will make you not ever want to purchase an HP printer again.Then after you sign into your account and install the Smart App, you have to log in yet again when you want to scan something.Overall, it took an hour to install and get it running."
35,1,Dysfunctional,"Worst printer ever! Makes you download an app, disconnects from devices frequently for no apparent reason, now this message- the print cartridges are not communicating correctly?! WTH?! It’s a huge pain. Don’t buy it! I’ve have had this for half a year and I’d throw it away at this point."
36,1,Never again,"I will never buy another HP printer for the rest of my life.It seemed to perform well at the outset, but just two days ago, the black print quickly faded.It TOLD me I had ample black ink. That was most certainly untrue. I decided to replace the ink.I replaced the cartridge just in case. It told me my ink had been updated. Then it told me I had no ink, then it told me I had a new ink cartridge.HP used to be exemplary. Now, it's cr*p. I won't make this mistake again. It seems to depend on consumers who think problems are their fault, and might want to throw good money after bad."
37,1,"Cartrides came nearly empty, takes forever to print","This pinter takes about 10 minutes to print after submitting the print job, even after multiple updates. On top of that, the 'new' cartridges came nearly empty and I had to replace all of them after about 10 small print jobs. Waste of time and money, avoid this printer."
38,1,The connectivity problems are true! Hours of setup work to print a few pages.,"The printer takes an extremely long time to get set up. I finally got it to print after messing with it on and off for a few days! After that it sat for about a week while I was on a business trip. Now I am back from the trip and needed to print a BOL while a driver is standing there waiting for me. It said it had a poor WiFi connection. (It has perfect WiFi signal) It would not do anything so i shut it off and turned it back on, Well it then decided to reset itself so it needed to be setup once again. After messing with it for 45 min I gave up and had the driver leave. Right now I have going on 3 hours trying to get it to print and have only gotten it to print about 10 pages. Total JUNK!"
39,1,Customer Service is Terrible,"The printer arrived and I followed all the steps for setup.  The tech called me to help me troubleshoot why the printer wouldn't work (I'm pretty computer savvy, so this should have been easy).  After remoting into my computer, the tech informed me that it was a firewall problem (which it isn't) and tried to sell me a $350 firewall package.  He also said that he couldn't fix the printer without it.  I declined and he became very insistent.  Minutes after I hung up with him, another tech supervisor calls me and tries to sell me the same package.  Then tells me they can fix the problem (that they said couldn't be fixed) for just a one time fee of $90.  Needless to say, I am absolutely furious with HP and will be returning their printer.  Never going to buy one again."
40,1,TRASH. Do Not Buy. Find something non HP!,This is a piece of crap. HP locked it down with so many security settings it’s unusable. HP is also now trying to monopolize ink. I put the XL cartridge in there and it has locked down the device saying it won’t print unless I put the same stock type in. It was the shortest life ink cartridge ever. Less than 200 copies before 3 of the four cartridges were out of ink.
41,1,Return & refund requested,"Printer display is stuck on ""HP cartridges must be enrolled in HP Instant Ink"" which we have done.  We would like to return this printer and get a refund.  Please advise asap it will not print.Also send us a return shipping label.  We cannot fix it.  Thanks"
42,1,It works ... ish,"Update 8/2The first printer was faulty. Contacted HP and they immediately sent a replacement. The replacement doesn't work either. It took over 2 hours to finally get my computer to recognize the new printer. I had to factory reset it over 5 times, and go through the whole process. Then, I got once I got it connect, the printer remained ""offline"". Literally one of the worst printers.This printer is probably one of theeee most irritating printers. When it works, it works.... slowly, but it works. It gets disconnected from the internet a lot, therefore when you want to print a page it takes like 10-15 minutes to get it back online and to start printing. It takes a bit for things to print. It's a bit on the slow side of printing. But, when it prints, it is clear and prints nicely."
43,1,Terrible,"Literally the worst printer you could find. There is always a problem with it that requires a lot of time to figure out. I have always had problems with it connecting to a computer, printing correctly, and just overall never working properly. Do not buy this printer."
44,1,Error message,"I have had this printer for about 6 weeks. It was working fine, but it does use a lot of ink. Out of the blue I get an error message and now can't print anything. I did some research and learned that this is a chronic problem with this model. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers to no avail. I am outside the return window and beyond frustrated."
45,1,Beware of HP Plus for Printers,"I got this printer because people always claimed HP had the best printers.  It works ok but the time it takes to print the first page is terrible  I think it was around 1 and a half.  Inkjets don't have to warm up so not sure what all it was doing.  It makes a lot of noise and stuff moves around a good bit before it ever prints.  But the worst part of HP Plus for Printers.  It tells you of all the great features but it is easy to overlook the one part where it tells you that turning it on only allows you to use HP cartridges.  If you turn it on by mistake or if you have automatic updates and it gets installed, there is no going back.  The XL cartridges are like $150 vs non which are around $30 to $40.Anyway, I got rid of mine after the starter ink ran out and got an Epson.  It is a better printer and it has refillable tanks.  They cost a little more upfront but are so worth it."
46,1,The worst user experience of any product I’ve ever owned,"I cannot believe how bad this printer is, and much less that a company of this size allows such a product to ship. Constant connection issues, takes seemingly 10min to print one page, requires an account and an app to work. Just a miserable experience."
47,1,Printer Problems,"Bought this printer on June 1, 2023 - March 1, 2024 so I had this printer 7 months. Nothing but touble. WiFi did not work right, printer would spool and clean heads for 5 - 6 minutes for each print job, this spooling/cleaning used up the printer ink cartridges after 4 print jobs, the complicated task of faxing made it useless, placed a new HP ink cartridge and error code ""foreign cartridge"" rendered the printer useless. Paid $100 for this printer when I could have gone to the library and printed 1000 sheets paper at 10 cents each. Plus $50 for 2 new ink cartridges equales another 1000 sheets of print. Use of the library fax is only 25 cents. This was a huge waste of money for a printer that was nothing but troubles entire 7 months.I will never buy another HP printer. Seems like HP rolls out multiple printer models each year. Sone have a short life while others have a long life. Some of these models may perform well and others do not perform, hold up or meet consumer expectations. This model is a waste of money, effort and patience. Buy anything but this model printer."
48,1,It is a huge scam.,"I am disappointed. We received and connected the printer. During the connection process, the prompts took us to activate a subscription without proper notice and in a very misleading manner. After three weeks or less, we began to receive paper and ink, only to discover that the Company had been tracking our usage of both items. Hence, the Company was billing us for paper and ink according to how much or how little we used both items. We called the Company and found out about the ""deal,"" which, in my opinion, is a misleading scam. Hence, we canceled. Now, I am ""trapped"" with ink cartridges that I was misled to pay for, and I cannot use them because those cartridges require an ink subscription. In other words, we inadvertently paid for services and products we cannot use. Money doesn't fall from a tree, and HP should know better. I am so upset and disappointed. I believe it is misleading, a scam, and a fraud. Please do not fall for it."
49,1,Go printers,I have had nothing but problems with this printer HP where always my favorite but now they are just not very good or versatileYou can only use there more expensive printer ink won’t stay connected or update very easy have to use there app and still wants to be a pain in butt.Worst printer I’ve owned and hp products have gotten so difficult and non versatile.
50,2,Ink is expensive,You run out of ink You got to take out a loan just to buy it.
51,2,No automatic double-sided scanning,"I am shocked that a printer/scanner in 2024 doesn’t do double-sided scanning automatically. To scan on both sides, you have to reload the documents and scan them again. Apparently the HP app will out the docs in order for you."
52,2,Junk,Had this printer a little over a year and it is no good.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still does not work.  Just spins and spins and does nothing will not buy it again.
53,2,"DOES NOT SCAN PROPERLY, PAPER JAMS AND DOESNT SCAN IN PDF","DOES NOT SCAN PROPERLY, PAPER JAMS AND DOESNT SCAN IN PDF"
54,2,Scam 'Free Ink',WARNING!! The printer is good. The 'free ink' promo is bogus. The price of new ink is based on the pages used not on the volume of ink used. HP controls when and how you purchase ink.Any ink you received as part of the original purchase  is rendered incompatible with the machine if you purchase/buy any new ink by any means other than the scheme rules of HP. I don't use much color ink. If I purchase a new black cartridge and install it. HP will send a notification that  the color ink cartridges in the machine are empty (incompatable with the printer) and force you to buy new ink cartridges.
55,2,No ink included in box!,"Bought on Prime day. States that ink is included in the box. It is not. This was supposed to be a NEW purchase, not refurbished"
56,2,Almost never works,"I’ve had lots of other HP printers and have generally not had many problems. However, this one always seems to disconnect from the network and I’ve had to restore factory defaults numerous times to make it connect to HP’s software, which is the only way to use it for scanning. I have had this printer for about 8 months and have had to reset at least 3 times. All the other printers worked fine and never required reconnecting multiple times. The aggravation of this printer lets me know I will not buy another HP printer no matter how good a deal it is."
57,2,Not worth the cost. The ink contsantly needs replacing.,"It is bulky, often the print quality is poor. Even after doing maintenance on the printer heads, which takes up a lot of ink, the printer is a disappointment. Once this machine dries out of my last ink replacement, it is going to the dump and I will find a better printer. I am a life long HP printer owner, but never will get this 8015e again."
58,2,Did I get a lemon?,"Bought this from Amazon/Office Depot. Had nothing but issues since. First it wouldn't communicate well with my PC - on and off whether it would or not. Next every scan page was 1 degree off being straight. Now it is jamming papers. I have looked inside to see if I can see anything on the pathway, but don't see anything. I have an annual tech support contract with HP that has been good, but I can't afford  time to keep putting up with these issues. I used to be an HP man, but I'm thinking differently."
59,2,Good… when it actually is working,"I’ve had nothing but issues with this printer since literally day one. First thing was it wasn’t registering that the paper tray was closed (even though it was), then stopped connecting to my internet and wouldn’t reset, numerous print head errors, and now, only blue is printing when all cartridges are full. Now I’m wasting a ton of ink cleaning and printing test pages. Stay away!"
60,2,"Error scanning, no USB","Occasionally the printer will stop working for no reason if you are not scanning with HP Smart... if you use Windows scan you will get the error attached to this review... also this is only a WIFI printer, no USB connection..."
61,2,Don’t get tricked,The printer is ok but don’t do the ink through HP! They will stop you from printing if they send you ink for a higher price and try use it after you cancelled program but paid for the ink! How they even monitor it is spooky! It does not connect to wifi most of the time creating lot of stress when need to print something for work
62,2,Not a good HP printer,"I have always had HP printers.  In fact, gave my old one to a friend who is still using it in her business.  I bought this for $200 on Amazon Prime Day 2023.  It is noisy.  Doesn't work well.  Hard to interface with my MAC.  I don't recommend this printer."
63,2,what to do  now that my printer no longer prints color,I bought this printer 3 months ago and the ink has already dried up. PLEASE. tell me what rtf do??? I thought this printer would last much longer for my occasional printing.  Please advise???????
64,2,Atrocious setup,"As someone else said, this thing is a pill to set up. I've set up many devices before, but this one. There are all sorts of instructions that it does not tell you. For example, for a device which may require the WPS of the unit, it only briefly comes up when trying to connect. It doesn't stay up for long. Basically, have the screen facing you to see brief items that pop up, like it asking if you want the printer to connect to your device. I had to watch tutorials in order to do it.Also, they do require you to use their app to use the wireless functionality. I would suggest going with Brother or something else. I won't buy another HP because of these issues."
65,2,Not worth the hassle.,"This machine really struggles just to do basic printing. Load, lot's of updates, disconnects from internet, and being forced to use the app for lot's of things is frustrating. No usb port is a major drawback. Spend more money and get a decent printer. Sounds like it'll break down anytime."
66,2,Always OFFLINE! Do not Recommend,I do not recommend this printer. I have decided to return. I always buy HP but this is the worst! It is always offline. I have to restart it each time I want to print. I have tried everything.  It is very wasteful of my time.
67,2,Programming (6 months free ink) Read this 1st.,"Be careful with HP Printers. I recently purchased this printer and was excited about the free ink for 6 months. In order to receive the ink you have to sign up with the online services. They monitor every page you print. If you don’t print you don’t receive any ink. If you do print and go over the page limit they charge you per 10 pages.Also, HP is not compatible with any other refillable ink. You have to purchase their expensive ink if you run out. I would have rather bought a Canon printer."
68,2,Returned.  Hate HP proprietary cartridges.,Liked the speed and print quality.  Have been a satisfied longtime HP user.  But… if you refill or install a third party cartridge the printer locks up when it recognizes a non HP cartridge. I’m told there might be a workaround but I decided to return.  I wish I had been warned before I purchased.  So frustrating!  For $30 more I bought Epson Eco Tank printer.
69,2,Not a very goodall-in-one,"The scanner is the most frustrating part of this printer. I'd say that it jams 50% of the time when I am scanning multiple pages from the document feeder. The printing itself works fine once the printer actually starts printing but the time it takes to ""queue"" up or whatever the printer is doing when making tons of noise is about 1 minute per print job."
70,2,Pulls Multiple pages when printing,Every single time I print something it pulls multiple pages and prints across 3 or 4 pages.
71,2,Don't buy this if you run a Linux operating system,"I bought this particular printer because they offered free ink for 6 months.  BUT  that is only if you have Windows or Apple.  They do not support Linux operating systems.  If I had seen the fine print, I would have gotten something else.  Since I am at least a little computer literate, I was able to get it to work, but there will be no free ink and no support.  Bah Humbug and Merry Christmas to you too HP"
72,2,Stopped working after 7 months,"The printer stopped working after 7 months of very light use. I tried all troubleshooting steps and when I ran diagnostics it told me there are no issues with the printer but that is not the case.I may not use it often but when I need or my kids do for school, I need it to function. Extremely disapppointed."
73,2,"No fax, not a simple set up","Key features (scan & fax) we’re locked out by “installer”…which translates to “the factory”Have set up countless printers in my years, but this one was the most frustrating, not because of complex processes, but because of limitations on what the printer would/could do. The auto setup feature basically firewalled every function except basic printing. Downloaded the latest HP app and all it wanted to do was get me to subscribe to HP+…Maybe time to try a different brand of printer??!!"
74,2,"hard to install, print speed is slow","I had to download an app to install the printer.  However, the app could not locate the printer !!Too bad HP had turned off manual install from printer it self.So I had to tun printer on/off many times to get the install going.  and every time the printer comes on it want to print an alignment page and scan something which a waste of ink, paper and time.finally managed to install with printer showing as some other model!!! print speed was slow."
75,2,It Works....,"Overall, it's a printer. Not great though. It prints fine, but there are things that arent as nice as the $50 HP  all-in-one that I had previously. It takes forever to start printing (appr. 2-3 minutes). The touch screen is ok, but doesn't keep the settings if it loses power. You have to reprogram your wifi into it, which is a pain. If you need a printer, this is ok. I would recommend spending a few more dollars and get something really nice."
76,2,Worked Only A Few Times,"I had it for a year now, and it worked a few times but has recently stopped working. It won't find the papers, so it won't ""grab"" to print and when canceled, it won't stop trying to print so it wastes ink. Is it too late to ask for a refund or something lmao is mine defective?"
77,2,HP Ink for life,The e Series locks you into only HP Ink. You'll be paying the highest cost in the marketplace for ink. The Black XL cartridge is 50% of what I paid for eh printer.
78,2,was good when it worked,worked well for 3 months than when I got new ink it still worked but one day it decided the ink was not original and stopped working  with no warning .looses the WIFI and I had to set it up all over again . and the horrible customer service where people barley speaking English which makes it hard to explain and understand .  basically look for different brand .
79,2,Very hard to set up,"What happened to the days when you just plugged it in, loaded the software and it worked. Sent it back because it would not print from more than one computer despite 2 days on the phone with tech support. Bought a 9020. Same problems. I hate these printers. I waste so much time just trying to get things to print. Hardwired to one of my computers and still have issues."
80,2,CUMBERSOME SETUP - Avoid,"As others have stated, this  thing wants you to sign up for so many online services - it WILL NOT work without an internet connection, so sorry if you just wanted a printer.  Big, ugly, cheap looking and working.  The insane amount of setup of services you don't want or need is an absolute deal killer.  I should have read the reviews.  If you want something that just works, this is not for you.  If you want to sign up for no less then three different accounts to get full functionality -  then this is the printer for you.  Garbage."
81,2,Runs out of inc fast,"This printer is efficient but unfortunately consumes ink quickly. While it delivers fast and reliable printing, the frequent need for ink replacement can be a drawback. If you have high-volume printing needs, be prepared for more frequent ink cartridge changes. However, if speed is a priority and you’re willing to manage ink usage, this printer can still be a valuable asset for its swift performance."
82,2,Don't waste your money,The unit does not do two-sided copies does not stay in sync if you do more than five pages good luck it'll print the wrong side get confused first two will come out good that's it it can't do more than two pages at a time
83,2,Color wise,I need to be cleaning the printer heads everyday. It’s ridiculous how many times I have to do it or how many times it ruins a project.
84,2,Messy ink change,I have had at least one ink cartridge leak both times I have changed the ink. The printer has an issue staying connected to my WiFi.
85,2,Doesn't last,"I purchased this printer for my classroom in October.  It is January and will no longer work correctly.  I get a printhead error every time I try to print.  I paid too much for a printer to only last 3-3 1/2 months.  I bought  a cheap model at local store, and it lasted for over 5 years."
86,2,Difficult set up.,I've worked with thus for hours and still can't get to send scans to computer. Just can't get a real customer service person. Be aware there is a scamm connected to customer service that infect your computer when looking for customer service.
87,2,WAY too complicated to Register,"I would not recommend buying an HP printer.  This is a low-end printer, but it is INCREDIBLY complicated to set up and it intrudes in asking for WAYYYY too much personal information which should not be required to print and scan.  You need to download software, you need to create an account.  I felt it was so intrusive and regret purchasing from this company.  moving forward I would not.  Not everything needs its own app....this is idiotic."
88,2,Retured this printer after 5 hrs of  trying  to  get it to scan.,"H.P. gave me there run around.the scanner won't  run on windows 11 . Its  Tax filing Time . They hope just throw it in closet, or say  well "" the copyer works"" .  Its ok dear."
89,2,Almost useless,Printer works maybe 30% of the timeBeen nothing but issues since the day I bought it
90,2,No power cord,"Printer was delivered with no power cord.  After being on hold with HP Customer Service for over 30 minutes, they are sending a power cord, but I have to wait 17 days for it, which seems excessive to me."
91,2,Great Printer. HUGE Flaw.,"Do not buy this printer if you are a Mac or iPhone user. This printer cannot scan to Macs or iPhones. I am extremely disappointed by this as this is a great printer with good, updated technology, so now I will have to restart the process for finding a printer that works with Apple products…"
92,2,Runs out of ink quickly,Runs out of ink quickly And in is only available online
93,2,Misleading Description,"The printer is great! Love the quality but the description of ""6 months free ink"" is a sham. It lasts two weeks and I only print maybe 4 things a day. Assuming it is a ploy to sell more printers. There is no option to order more under the 6 months."
94,2,Tried to get it fixed,This was a good printer for the most part.I just had a problem with it and I tried calling the HP support to nit much avail.I really need a printer at home which is making me buy a new one right now.i have also changed the brand ..see how that goes
95,2,Get ready for a headache of a setup,"OK product, conforms to anything else, just get ready for 500 questions trying to access your phone, computer, and wifi.  Give yourself 2 hours planned out to prevent a mental meltdown."
96,2,S-L-O-W printer,Very slow to print! Color printing is atrociously s-l-o-w
97,2,So Disappointed,"The printer arrived with a defect on the paper catcher, but it was workable, so I began using it.  The print quality is fine.  However, I was only able to print a small number of pages before the black ink ran out.  This only comes with a black set-up cartridge, so I'm having to spend $42  to buy one until the Instant Ink arrives.  Poorly done, HP."
98,2,Basic yet Useful,"This will print from your phone's photos or files. It's soooo SLOW. Takes forever to receive print jobs and execute the print, omg. So, definitely a great 1st time printer."
99,2,"Prints fast, but a real pain!","Not a fan of the ink subscription you almost have to agree to.  If you turn off the power it loses all settings incl. WiFi pw.  It is not simple to set up the connections w/ WiFi, laptop and Samsung phones.  It does print fast and clear on front and back of pages tho'.  Would def. not purchase again."
100,3,Small jobs,This was extremely easy to set up. Only complaint is that it runs out of ink fast and you have to replace the ink with official HP ink as it will not read HP ink that isn’t official.
101,3,Does not work,It does not print with dark ink.Just light colored ink
102,3,"Good printer, poor scanner, poor duplex functionality","Print quality is good, but now-a-days pretty much all printers can ""print"" pretty good quality, so it doesn't set this apart from others.  The scanner feed for multiple pages always produces crooked print copies or scanned documents. So if quality scans, especially for business or formal documents is important to you, I would skip this printer. The only way to get a perfectly aligned copy or scanned document is to manually place the document on the glass and scan each page individually (what a hassle!).  The duplex function is useless: When trying to use the scanner to reproduce a document with double sided print, it will scan both sides but the copies or scans it produces are single sided.... why? why? why? Who at HP thought this was a good idea to consume more paper in making copies than used in the original document."
103,3,well made,its really slow!
104,3,Ink sucks in two ways.,"Ok. People complain about set up. It’s not hard. Go to settings, printers and scanners, add it and follow directions…….but, the ink is terrible. Makes fine copies, for an ink jet, but I am buying new ink, beginning of January ‘24, when I got it end of October. 2 months? And I rarely print. Does not accept non HP ink. Supposed to be a way to disable it, but it hasn’t worked for me. We will see how long the second round of ink goes.Good printer, crappy ink."
105,3,No Power Cord - Scanner jams with folded documents,Printer was in a sealed box that did not appear to have been previously opened. There was no power cord included in the box. When scanning a document that had been folded to put in an envelope the document feeder jammed several times while trying to scan. Had to straighten out the document and try later.
106,3,Prints Great!,Prints Quality copies needs to print Faster.
107,3,Consider ink replacement,"The printer works great, but HP does not allow after market ink and will lock up the printer. Price the HP brand ink replacement to make sure this is your best option."
108,3,HP 8015e Printer,"The printer was difficult to set-up.  It wants to use wi-fi but my old desktop doesn't have wi-fi.  It says a USB cable can be used but doesn't give clear instructions.  Somehow I stumbled through set-up but I don't know how.I'm also disappointed HP is rigging the printer to reject non-HP ink cartridges.  If I'd have know that, I might have chosen a different brand."
109,3,So-so printer but not typical hp quality,"I'm not sure why but all the plastic trays and doors squeal when opened and closed. Rather grating and stiff feeling rather than smooth. Print quality isn't the best but fine for most home or small office uses, however I was replacing a 7058e model and it just doesn't stand up to the earlier one. The scanner feeder works great and I like the paper tray's larger capacity, but given the chance I wouldn't buy this model again. Just found myself in a pinch."
110,3,Slowest printer ever,"My 15 year old1053 series was way faster but was a problem connecting to my new laptop, so I got this new one.. This one looks pretty but I miss my old one for speed and quality"
111,3,Last HP printer that I will ever buy.,"This printer took me 3 hours to get it to work wirelessly with two computers.  Was forced to go online to get it to work, then was also forced to enroll in HP's auto ink renewal program.  Have owned several HP printers over the years but this will be the last one I buy ever."
112,3,HP Officejet 8015e,"I would like to return this product for credit under the warranty, as the document feeder doesn’t work properly."
113,3,It can only have 5 devices,"It’s not a direct wireless printer — you have to download the software (HP Smart) on the device to print, and only 5 devices can be connected. I have a four family household. Why was this not made apparent? We had to carefully pick and choose what devices get to print and which ones don’t."
114,3,Not sure about this printer!,"I purchased this printer with high hopes that it would be as good as my last printer, but I am not sure. The pull-out tray to catch the copies and the paper tray are flimsy. But what is worrying me is the fact that I have had three paper jams in one day.  I may end up returning this item if I can't get more comfortable with it."
115,3,Why is Everything So Poorly Made these Days?,"I've bought HP printers all along.  Now I'm looking for a better quality brand.  I'm sorry I purchased this.  If I had known it was going to be so flimsy, I would have paid more for a different brand.  Unfortunately, I expected for than they gave. :-("
116,3,Merely OK,"No so easy to set up.  Using by wire, as can’t download proper software. Tech assist told me I had Trojan horses blocking download & wanting to sell me software to unblock at cost of $200 - $250.  Had laptop checked by my own tech & nothing there.  Still can’t download without subscribing for ink.  Too expensive.  Quality of machine is cheap, but operates properly - adequate for light use."
117,3,Does not scan both sides ;(,"You would think scan both sides is a standard feature on all in one printers now days, but no, here I am flipping pages like it’s 1999!! Price was great, so I guess you get what you pay for."
118,3,Oh my!,"HP officejet 9015e. Manufacturing of this printer is sparce at best. The gimmick 6 months of free ink and extended warranty, always question the gifted purchases! This printer is you pay for what you get! The print and scanning at normal quality is very slow! Print quality at normal, produces a blurry print. The scan function scans sheets angled, I tried to correct it but it continued to scan angles. My old HP printer had the same problem. This was the only reason I purchased this printer is price and document feeder! I have a lot of papers to scan them into my PC's back up HD."
119,3,"Love the printer, don’t get trapped by HP","I love my OfficeJet8015e. Works great and connects well with my phone and other devices for easy printing. However, beware, if you sign up for Instant Ink+, you cannot use those cartridges if you cancel your subscription. I’ve also learned the hard way that you can ONLY use HP ink if you  sign up for HP+ software when you set up your printer. I wouldn't have bought an HP if I had known this prior."
120,3,Quality,"Disappointed in the quality of this printer.  I have only used HP printers in the past and they have lasted for years.  The plastic paper tray was flimsy and anytime I tried to make a copy, the printer would grab all the paper in the tray and would jam.  I still believe in HP and I'll try another."
121,3,"Setup was clunky, loses Internet connection and is slow to begin printing","While this is a great deal for the price, getting the printer connected to wifi, my laptop, and my iphone was really clunky.  I must have started from scratch a half dozen times, and while the blue network light on the printer was oftentimes solid, I couldn't find the printer on my laptop or iphone.  And the setup on the HP Smart app would just freeze, or error out.  Then, for no apparent reason, the setup finally completed.  Go figure.Fast forward a few weeks… it often loses connection with the router (which is just 10 feet away), and is very slow to begin printing after reconnecting."
122,3,Piece of cheap plastic,The paper tray easily breaks when removed.  The entire printer has the feel of cheap plastic that could break any time - and it did!
123,3,must be hooked up wireless.  I wanted a wire connection to printer.,must be hooked up wireless.  I wanted a wire connection to printer the free ink means almost nothing to me as I often print vary little and do not want to get tied up to ink deliveries I have no control over.  I will keep my old Officejet 4622 and give this to my grandson.  I am long retired what in the world would I use my phone to print?
124,3,Printy Quility,Paper tray is very fragil must wiggle to slide in or out.  Quility of printer cheaply made.
125,3,quality,"paper tray components are not very sturdy & hard to pull out. A piece was already broken when I opened  it!I was very happy with my previous HP all in one printer, not so sure about this one!!"
126,3,Don't Order,"I can only print from my phone. If I want to print from my laptop I have to unplug and plug in the printer and restart my computer. Such a pain. From the phone a breeze, but would like to do it from my laptop."
127,3,"Printer fine, but be aware….","You positively HAVE to use HP ink, which is so much more expensive than others that should be compatible.  I wrote HP with complaint, but doesn’t change a thing."
128,3,Horrible Ink Cartridges,"The worst thing is the ink cartridges. They came with hard plastic guards that are impossible to remove with out spilling ink out all over your hands. They seem like they are glued onto the cartridges. A lot of ink lost just trying to get them ready to install. Once installed, they work fine. FREE ink for 6 months? Not such a bargain. The output tray has to be manually extended. It doesn't slide easily. I got spoiled with my Envy printer, which I loved. I wouldn't buy another HP OfficeJet printer. Flimsy."
129,3,It's awfully big!,"For some reason my old HP all in one printer has decided (all of a sudden) that the ink cartridge is not compatible.  I ordered the new one and it seems very big!  Be sure and check your space.  I have yet to set it up, and will update my review after.  At this writing I'm disappointed that it is so big, and that another reviewer mentioned that the ink cartridges are tiny.....Im not much for change..."
130,3,No personal Control of printer,The printer works fine but it requires you to sign in to an app to use it EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is annoying and seems a bit controlling of HP to not allow the printer to print unless you first sign in. I had a recent power outage and it required me to reinstall the printer all over again. I'd spend a bit more and buy a less controlling printer.
131,3,Scanning with macOS not so easy.,"Very easy install, but when I tried to scan from the printer to my Mac the message said not compatible with macOS.  Was able to scan using the HP printer program on my Mac, but had to download the app to my phone to scan multiple pages on the flatbed.  Previous two HP printers were better suited to scanning."
132,3,Hp printer was bigger than I expected,Very heavy
133,3,The setup sucked,"I like everything BUT it took me two hours to get it to print from my laptop and iPhone. You have to get a code that’s emailed to you…well, I tried 2 different email accounts and on about the 10th attempt, the email finally came through.Other than that, it’s a really nice printer"
134,3,set up difficult,"I have been setting up printers since the dark days of MS DOS.  Those days required downloading drivers based on the software to be used.  I have not had as much difficulty getting a printer on line and printing since those early days.  The printer works fine and the cost was resonable, but it took me a day and a half and much frustration before the printer began to work properly."
135,3,False advertising by Amazon. This printer does not fax.,"You have given false information. Your advertising is false. Under key features, you say this machine is a printer copier, scanner and fax machine. It is not a fax! There is not anywhere to plug in a telephone wire.If I had know this, I would not have made this purchase! I don't have time for this! I am so disappointed. How can I get a refund or exchange?"
136,3,Refund amount reduced by Amazon,HP said they refunded $164.79 but only $142.44 was deposited to my credit card.
137,3,Not keeping up with the free 6 months cartridge,"The sale was supposed to have included a 6 months free cartridges, so far I have only received one replacement of my cartridges."
138,3,FAXING,I couldn't not receive fax but couldn't receive fax.
139,3,Touch screen,The touch screen is way too sensitive and difficult to navigate. I bought the cheapest model available and I got what I paid for.
140,3,Jams very easily,home use
141,3,Don't buy this,"I've had HP printers all my life , the quality has gone to hell. This wont pick up paper unless you shove it in tray and then it frequently pops out. Looks like a slider should fit up to paper but it doesn't move.  It does print well, but annoying trying to get the paper to pick  up!"
142,3,Beaware of ordering printer,"The printer prints nice, everything came packaged properly, but it was missing a printer cord and power cord. When you have a old printer with old cords hold on to them because the new products are being sold without parts. Printer with no ethenet cord or printer cord or power cord. Also, some printers dont come with ink."
143,3,Good value,"Prints well, but set up was difficult. Would like it to double side scan from the feeder. It has to be done manually.  We had to call fir set up assistance."
144,3,cannot scan with MAC OS,"bluetooth/wireless printing is great. However, i also bought this with the intent to scan documents for e-copies. However, if you have a Mac -the scanning feature is currently not supported. Will now be buying a seperate scanner."
145,3,Buyer warning! Requires monthly subscription or they shut printer down.,Printer quality is fine. Hassle of them controlling or forcing  monthly subscription is horrible.Once you cancel HP truely shut down your printer.  Will or print.Buyer be ware heads-up.
146,3,Difficult to install.,"Needed 20 minutes of on line tech help for installation. Works ok with Apple Ipad and Iphone11 (air print) which was my original intention. Not successful yet with HP desktop. If the printing has heavy color, must wait for drying time before the page exits the tray."
147,3,Able to print from my phone and my laptop,The printer keeps going off line
148,3,Wanna be,This printer is a wanna be professional printer. The color was not very vibrant and the connection to internet was awful. Would not recommend. Setup was not the best. I miss the old printers that didn't require internet.
149,3,A headache,"If you want to deal with an issue every time you want to print something, please get this printer."
150,4,Hp printer,"I was told I would get free ink , but never got any info. What is the deal. Printer is greatWhere’s the free ink. This is what irks me about Amazon. HELPSHOW ME HOW TO GET MY FREE INK 🥴"
151,4,Hp headach,Not that easy to set up had to have help. Did not know about needing to only use hp ink
152,4,Hp printer,The starter pack of inks were not included. It looked as though this printer package had been opened before. It was probably a return & then sold to me.
153,4,Great printer,Takes a minute to start up but once it is setup it has worked great for me with no issues . I think the value was decent too from other printers I compared. Scans and prints good also easy to use and decent size. Not too big not too small
154,4,Nice printer at good price,Fairly easy to set up wireless to my home network. Prints fast and well. However I'm not looking forward to the cost of ink when the time comes thus 4 stars and not five.
155,4,Instant Ink Problems,The printer if fine but never could get the Instant Ink to activate.
156,4,Very Nice Printer/Copier,The HP 8015e appears to be a good printer especially for the price.  The only problem is it can be difficult to setup but eventually you will get there.  I called HP for help and they were very good to work with.
157,4,Good,"It’s been pretty good so far. I’m having troubles with the scanner as it never wants to connect to the computer. The Wi-Fi part is a little jank other than that it’s really good for the price. I also got the six month ink deal, it is five dollars you get six months of extra ink, so that’s a pretty great deal itself."
158,4,Not the easiest,But HP is one of the best. I wanted it to work with my cell phone but I could not get that to work. I followed all directions to a T and my phone is paired with the printer but the printer can't see my cell phone.
159,4,"Great printer, awful free ink incentive","The printer works well and the top feeder is great for scanning applications.  However, the incentive for free ink offered in the advertising is awful.  The printer came with start-up ink.  However, the offer was not for free ink in six months, only two.  In addition, when my two month offer was over, I still had not emptied the initial ink cartridges.  I cancelled my subscription after two months.  However, it means that the ink provided as replacement cannot be used because I am no longer subscribed to HP Instant Ink.  I would recommend receiving credits for replacement ink as opposed to a subscription service."
160,4,Good variety for price,This all in one printer is compact and easy to use.  The only thing I don't like about it is that printing takes a while. It makes several clicking sounds like the ink cartridges are moving back and forth trying to decide to print or not. Otherwise it is simple to set up and use the features.  I have not had to use the tech support so 4 stars given
161,4,Did the job,The color
162,4,Pain to install software,"You go to a website to set the printer up. It takes you to a Microsoft app. (YUCK) It kept hanging up. So I skipped that and logged into the HP website, and downloaded the executable installer. Finally got it to install the wireless drivers, but still having trouble getting it to install drivers for USB cable. It's works fine now I could see a new user give up."
163,4,Very disappointing,"I purchased this printer in July, 2023. I don’t know how it became uninstalled, but the Smart App and the set up instructions are not working for reinstalling this printer. I certainly hope I’m not going to be forced to purchase another printer!  I have spent 2 1/2 months trying to solve this set up issue to no avail."
164,4,"Connecting was easy, until it wasn’t","This printer came in and was set up in minutes.  Had no issue with connecting my phone for remote printing.  However, later on could not get my wife’s phone to connect.  Otherwise print quality is good and at a great price."
165,4,Good Quality,"Good quality except that to get software updates, you get blackmailed into only buying HP cartridges."
166,4,Serves my needs.,For home use only.  Had trouble signing up for instant ink.
167,4,Nice,"Very nice. came packaged well. Pretty easy to set up, although the app is slightly annoying. Nonetheless, super happy to have an easy, functioning printer/copier. It works well and prints quickly."
168,4,Reliable,I use hp always and am satisfied with the performance
169,4,Great value,"I was about to give up hope on HP printers. I absolutely love the ink plan, which is why I've stayed loyal to the brand. This printer is definitely worth the price. It's sturdy (18 pounds!) But not so bulky that it's obnoxious. No connectivity issues so far like I had with every other HP printer I've owned. Fast shipping and relatively easy setup. I would recommend it."
170,4,Decent,"This is a decent machine. It does everything it is purported to do. Fits my needs. That being said, I am a bit concerned about how lightweight it is. It feels like it will fall apart it I move it. But, so far, so good; and I haven't been extra careful. So, maybe I am worrying about nothing. As I said, fits my needs."
171,4,Easy set up,It was easy to set up and I was able to print my insurance cards from my email. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was advertised 6 months of free ink but it’s a scam. You have to sign up for an ink plan. It says you can cancel when you want but that’s not what was advertised. Really frustrating when companies pull scams like this
172,4,It works well but...,the oklder model 8630 was 10 times better.  this one uses ink too fast.
173,4,Not a fax Machine,"Hook up and set up were super quick. Much easier than previous generations. Photo print is great. Having trouble getting envelopes to print right.Happy with everything else so far, EXCEPT... I was really looking for a unit that could fax. In the description it says it faxes.Much later on, on different pages, one finds out that it can 'Mobile Fax.'  Haven't played with that yet, but occasionally, yes rarely, but occasionally, I need to fax a piece of paper. Not scan and email.I can adapt. I'm just miffed because I was led to believe I didn't have to."
174,4,Love the WiFi printing,"Set up did not go smoothly for me…had to call tech support twice. But once it was set up, I love the convenience and the print quality is fine for my purposes. This is a good printer for the price."
175,4,Paper catch tray flimsy,Overall good printer.  Tray that catches printed paper a little hard to open and close.
176,4,Ink quality and easy to use,It's prints good but the overall quality of the printer is kinda of ok. The plastic feel very fragile
177,4,Easy hookup,Runs great easy hook up. Prints nice quality black and white as I use it
178,4,It's an HP.  I expect quality.,Currently having paper jam issues.  Not quite sure what is causing it.  Will change paper and see if that helps.
179,4,Nice and easy to set up,"Great printer.  I added it to my home office. Easy to set up, scan, print, and copy.  Quiet and quick."
180,4,good fit,"use of HP help was very not helpful as MAIN objective was to sell us a ""insurance /protection ""police for extra amount $100 for a year or larger amount for longer.  If you referred to a HP 'TECHNICIAN"" good luck as they are glorified sales personnel.  Able to be able to get printer to function on our own.  Just for info the problem was not the printer is was with both of our computers.  AKA sell you 2 computers to get your printer to work or give us for $100 each update our laptops.  BE CAREFULL USING HP HELP."
181,4,It prints fine and wireless,"When I add paper or checks to print, it's hard to get the lid to fit on the paper tray. It can get frustrating. But I like it being wireless and they have sent us more ink for free which is awesome! I would still buy it again."
182,4,Works great but lacks feature,"Does everything that I need if you leave it powered on, but my old printer would wake up without being powered on when I sent a print job to it from my phone or laptop.  This one must be powered on before you send a print job to it.  I don’t print much of anything anymore and don’t usually have it powered on. I really liked that feature and miss it a lot!"
183,4,Good,Some features are a little hard to figure out but with time I think will be a great printer. Just hope it last as long as my last HP.. 20 yrs!!
184,4,Have always use HP printers,Very familiar with HP printers and therefore purchased another. Harder to set up without a CD but had to download from online programs.
185,4,Energy savings,They want me to leave it on all the time for updates that sucks up electricity other than that the printer quality is okay.
186,4,printer hook up was hard to figure out,"had one HE-- of a time trying to figure out making it work. I could not get it to print anything but the info screen. Went through a lot of time, ink & paper to watch it print the same thing ! Have used HP for years for all my home printing which is not much ."
187,4,HP 8015e,"The only thing that was a little tougher to set up was the scan to email. However, I am old school and not as technically equiped."
188,4,Does its job well,"The scanning feeder makes scanning in multiple pages at once very easy. For double sided scanning it requires you to use the app to rearrange the page order after separately scanning both sides of your documents, but it's still easier than scanning one page at a time."
189,4,Some issues with HP Smart,"It's a great printer don't get me wrong, but I've ran into some issues with the software. I've had trouble trying to log in just to try and scan some papers. It opens up in the browser and depending on what you use as a browser, you may run into issues. The ink does not seem to last very long, but I don't have much experience with other printers and I have used it often enough."
190,4,Easy to set up,"This printer is pretty noisy while printing, but gets the job done."
191,4,Works well,Wish it would print business card
192,4,Easy setup,This printer works great. This is my first wireless printer and the set up was nice and easy!
193,4,Great,Is a good item
194,4,HP OfficeJet 8015e,"The print quality of the printer is excellent, but the paper tray and paper output tray are  very flimsy (poor quality)"
195,4,Great printer,"The only thing I don’t like is the paper tray. I can’t figure out how to adjust it to hold the paper tight. Other than that, it’s great."
196,4,HP Printer/Scanner/Fax does not Fax.,"HP Printer/Scanner/Fax This model prints well, scans well. I am very disappointed that it does not directly Fax. It takes you down a rabbit hole using your mobile to fax. We do not send and receive faxes. We now using eFax to send and receive faxes adding an unnecessary monthly cost. When a printer is sold as a fax on its capabilities it should be able to fax as my past multi-function printers"
197,4,Tiny ink cartridges,Works great but the ink cartridges are very small and if I would have known that I would not have gotten this printer. I print a ton and it’s annoying to constantly have to change them. My old HP was not like this and only had a colored one and black one and they lasted a long time before needing to change them
198,4,HP Printer 8015E,"It took me a while to get this printer up and running but got it done by trial and error. After getting it going and setup, it prints very well. Instructions don't really help much and until you get it almost completely setup there isn't anyone to contact for help."
199,4,Double sided printing,double sided printing is great
200,5,Great product,Home use and easy setup.Performs perfectly!
201,5,HP GREAT PRODUCT!!!?,"I had an HP printer for years... When it went out...I finally decided to purchase this one..I was really on the fence about a refurbished... I am so happy w this purchase...the print color size and functionality are just as good had I bought new! I can print from my phone and laptop..the warranty is a great price as well... Whenever I was setting up I did have a couple of questions...HP customer service WAS AND STILL ARE always so kind professional and ""patient"" to help...the ink and paper programs can not be beat.. I'll always recommend HP to anyone!"
202,5,Buyer Beware!! Horrible quality and ink issues,"First off the quality is terrible. It starts making noises out of nowhere, even late at night. Connecting from certain devices is impossible.Second, more troubling - generic inks which are cheap will NOT work. the Machine basically stops working when you try to insert non-HP ink. We bought ink from HP and it was essentially empty. It was so light I couldn't believe it when I opened it. I changed to the new ink and the low ink came on. it prints faintly and streaks all the time anyway. Spend a little more and go with a better brand. AVOID this company."
203,5,easy to set up and use,Much easier to get connected and set up >
204,5,"Good printer, reasonably priced","Bought this when my previous HP printer just wasn't printing well anymore, even after replacing ink cartridges, etc.  Glad I bought it as my prints are 100% improved.  Wi-fi direct printing working well also, very happy overall."
205,5,Functionality,Good printer for a multitude of uses.
206,5,"Value, functions, size, quality","Very easy to set up, prints great, good buy for the price."
207,5,Easy set-up,HP OfficeJet 8015e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer came in well packaged and was very easy to set up.  Then download the HP Smart app if you don't already have it and you are ready to go.  I like the automatic document feeder feature and it works well.
208,5,Not as compatable as they would have you to believe,"If you own a Mac with an intel processor you no that apple has just recently stopped support Mac’s with the Intel Processor I think HP jumped the gun just a bit by not providing a work around since Many businesses are still trying to upgrade their Mac systems.  Despite this overlook I’’s a wonderful printer at a great price, but look at the cost of the ink cartridges before you jump in.  You can over come this shock if you choose to own it rather that lease it, by enrolling in the instant ink and or paper services.  For a monthly fee they monitor you ink and  if you choose their paper  service, lapped usage and before you run out they ship you ink or paper before you run out.  I tried to take a guess at my printer usage a was I off so without any issue during there trial period I changed my plan.  Now I don’t need to go to the Office supply store or order online hoping that they have my cartridge in stock or if the ink will be here on time."
209,5,New printer,I am very happy with my new printer. My neighbor set up for me and they are ordering one also. Great price
210,5,Refurbished is AWESOME!,"I bought this HP printer refurbished, and I have to explain, not only was the price beyond incredible, I received this printer and it was as good as brand new.  I saved the earth from having one more plastic printer buried in it, paid an incredibly low price, and received incentive deals as well.  Check out refurbished. I am amazed, and seriously, HP is truly the best printer out there for the home office."
211,5,Buena calidad,
212,5,Excelente calidad,"Me gustó el producto porque es facil de usar, rápido, y además las impresiones son de excelente calidad, puedes moverlo a cualquier lugar donde lo necesites, y su tamaño es ideal, me encanto"
213,5,Best printer ever!,Would definitely buy again. Easy to install! Functions perfectly! Print quantity is even better than I expected! Very durable! Colors are vibrant! Love it!
214,5,Very crisp printing. Lots of features.,"My old HP died so I got this model. Had scan, fax, print, etc. The set up was a little tedious but then I reverted to my knowledge of my past HP model.  The new printer and I set up some of the features all by ourselves using the machines home screen, ignoring the ""new and improved"" online instructs.The machine is very quiet. I do like this machine's scan feature as it lets you choose to fax, email or save once the scan is completed. I would take away a half star for the bottom paper tray being sort of cheaply put together and has to be handled carefully when opening and closing."
215,5,good quality HP printer,I always buy HP printers as they are reasonably priced and do not use a lot of ink. I do a lot of printing and I generally am able to get 3 to 4 years usage. I do not recommend this for bulk printing. I am somewhat disastified with HP as I could not figure out how to scan multiple sheets and when I contacted HP for support they did nothing to help me.
216,5,just what I need,"I have started at the small notary business and don’t have the money for one of the higher and laser printers just yet. I needed something in a pinch that would suit my needs in this particular printer filled that gap nicely.  I absolutely love the double sided printing option. It works really well.  My only gripe is that the software the manufacturer uses for printing is not the best. It’s a small pain point, but it might be something that would discourage other folks so it’s best to disclose that."
217,5,Works great for the price,It was easy to setup and way to use.
218,5,Worth to buy,"Easy setup, good qulity.100 times better than cannon printer."
219,5,exceptional  printer.,"I love my printer.  works great.  set up by best buy.  I have contract.  the help line was suposed to be free but they wanted a lot of money and had to be contract to tale out international viruses, malware,  Thank God for Best buy.  they are the best."
220,5,great printer for the price.,I have a small tax firm and we dont print anymore so often. So a laser is not an option for us. This officejet is exacly what we needed.
221,5,Reliable hp product. It is not going to be a workhorse like the  8600,"It's not as big and easier to handle than the HP 8600 that I replaced. The new one is combined with the other one I have so I can use these for work. You don't get as much ink from the newer ones, but this printer was not made to do the work of the HP 8600. If they still made the HP8600 I would have bought that one. If your printer says it doesn't recognize your aftermarket ink, shut it off, disconnect the printer completely and turn it back on. It will then clear the memory of the HP cartridge and then you can use the other ink."
222,5,Mi mejor experiencia con impresoras,"He tenido varias impresoras, sobre todo de la marca HP por eso me decidi por esta despues de hacer varias busquedas. El delivery fue bastante rapido y las oferts muy buenas. Facil de instalar con todas las indicaciones precisas. La puedes conecyar a varios dispositivos a la vez e imprimir desde la distancia de forma rapida y precisa. La calidad es excelente y las subscripcion para la tinta y el papel llega rapido y de muy buena calidad. Me gusto mucho esta impresora"
223,5,Wonderful,Wonderful
224,5,Easy to Use / Quality Printer!,"Easy to Use & quality printer. I would definitely recommend using the 6 month ink trial if you print a lot. I did read that you have to keep using HP official ink once you start the Instant Ink, but I think it is worth it."
225,5,Got a great deal on it and it works great.,Was fortunate to find this on sale just as my printer died! It has been a space saver but does all the things a larger footprint printer can do. It is actually pretty quite while printing. Have not learned everything about it but so far I really like this printer plus the ink is not as expensive as some others I have had plus I could find the cartridges at one of the giant warehouse clubs for a good price.
226,5,Excellent Print Quality + Linux Friendly,"I have/had an Envy 6055e which was problematic from day one. For some reason, it ""decided"" that it would no longer connect to my network. Most of the problems stem from the fact that it has no panel (never again). Moreover, there was considerable latency from computer to printout.This Office Jet does have an LED panel. It took me about five minutes, using my phone, to set up the printer. You could also set it up from the panel. This thing is much faster than the Envy, and it is less expensive. The Envy is possibly a better photo printer.I once had to scan 80 pages for a ProPublica article I was contributing to. It took many hours. This Office Jet has a document feeder. Overall, the print quality is superb and fast. No smears. I am extremely satisfied.My configuration: socket://192.168.1.207:9100"
227,5,Great printer,I love everything thing about it! The feed function is great! I recently had to scan 28 pages and was able to send them through the feed function with no issues!
228,5,A Real Winner,"I have 2 heavy-duty laser color printers in my home office, a brother and lexmark, both of which have 5-star print quality and durability. I get HP all-in-ones for their quality scanning and to print drafts mostly.  I was always impressed with the print quality, but on several occasions I forgot to switch to a laser on a print job then printed again, only to stare at both sets of docs in excruciating detail to figure out which was which. The HP software is a bit meddlesome but easy enough to use, especially when scanning to file. This thing has never jammed, even with heavier card stock or glossy to print photos - where it really holds its own. I'm not an HP laser guy but on ink jets that is all I ever get and this printer has set the bar even higher. Sets up real easy and was a breeze to connect to WiFi -- it's quiet, fast, and punches way above its price."
229,5,great,"bought this to print our wedding stationary and print on envelopes bc it was literally cheaper to buy a $150 printer than pay a printer to do all of that stuff for us (side note on that - weddings are a scam?) anyways, super easy to set up on wifi, the tray has those arm things you can move to accommodate different paper sizes. i printed on several sizes of envelopes with this back and front. i have not used the fax part yet bc it's not 1963 but i'm sure it's fine"
230,5,Works great,"this prints boldly, with great indicators of when the ink is running low and easy access to order more. It has made printing a breeze!"
231,5,"Great Printer, love 💖 it !","I'm a fan of HP and I have been for many years.So far so good!I managed to find the paper holder and what a strange area, plus you have to bend the paper to get it in the tray.  Ok. No biggie.  I don't see how you could print anything larger than the standard size paper.So far set up has gone well .I have to finish it up.After awhile I will update my review and let you folks know how it has gone.I love it so far!!A few quirks but not enough to deter me from giving the printer a good review.The Canon was returned to WM.  On sale now and I am using the Amazon 3 pay, no interest.What a good deal!!Thank you Amazon and HP!!💞"
232,5,"Like the printer, watch the ink","I have had HP printers for years. I really like the instant ink program which manages to always keep me supplied.  However, I don't like the ink cartridges on this printer, i had ink on my hands and clothes before I realized it.  Be careful installing them, there is essentially an open port you do not want to touch.  Otherwise, they are easy enough to install and printer was a snap to set up."
233,5,Nice printer with all my WiFi control....,This printer is twice as fast as my old OfficeJet Printer and functions very well from all of my devices with very nice print quality.
234,5,Hp is best,Have not set up yet but anticipated it’s going to be a Butte VZ when it’s done
235,5,Keeps going offlne,SO in general I like it. However it keeps going off line  I guess its a setting I need to change and do notknow how to do it so have to set aside the time to let tech support log int my computer to change it for me.  I have instant ink as well so  6 months free ink came with it  and get the extra paper too.  If you go that route up in the new ink when it arrives or your printer will not work.  ( that drove me nuts until I thought HMMM I wonder ) AND YUP  I was right  it started working however the going off line thing is a pain.  My other HP Envy never went off line and so when my kids needed to print from their room it just worked.  If anyone knows the fix please respond  Id love it if that was fixed.
236,5,Great Buy,"I had my old printer so long that HP did not recognize the serial number when I sought help with a failed paper sensor. This new printer is excellent. It was easy to set up with both wifi and direct line to an old HP desktop. Color photos come out far better than expected. The free ink just about equals the cost of the printer. And while there is a push by HP to sign up for a regular ink supply, at a monthly fee, you can delay that decision for six months. The display on the printer is modest, but notices of any printing problems now pop up on my computer screen.Once again I am glad that I went by Amazon's recommendation. That saved me a lot of time finding a printer I really like.."
237,5,This is a really terrific product!,"Easy to set up, easy to use, this beats the heck out of any Epson product. And I used to be an Epson girl. After four Epson printers with never-ending problems, I switched over to this and will never go back!"
238,5,Amazing,"Im very happy with my purchase, great size, great quality, quick connection easy to use. Ink quality is excellent. Fast shipping definitely will buy from this seller again."
239,5,"Easy, easy",This printer was easy to install and connect with my wifi and laptop. I'm not tech savvy but I read and follow instructions well. It does everything I need in my small home office area.
240,5,Great Value,"This is exactly what we needed,  Great printer for home office."
241,5,Impresora,La verdad cumplió mis expectativas. Me a salido muy buena y trabaja perfecto . La uso para trabajos personales .
242,5,easy install works great,easy to install works well
243,5,Gets the job done !,Works great ! Just wish you could make the printing size way smaller . Does not give you many options in size . Besides that works great !
244,5,Great!,I bought this for my home office and so far it has been great. I did sign up for the Auto ink replacement and everything is going well.
245,5,"Perfect Printer for High-Quality, Affordability, and Function!","My husband and I work from home and needed an inexpensive printer that had multiple functions and printed high quality. We chose the HP Office Jet 8015e Wireless, Color, All in One Printer with 6 months free ink with HP+(228F5A), White, white and gray. extra ink arrived in days of our purchase.This all-in-one printer will print, copy,  and scan, and will do 2-sided printing. You can use your phone to run all its functions. It has built-in security to enhance protection from viruses and malware. It also detects and resolves connectivity problems, which is a must for me. This printer keeps itself up to date and fixes any issues automatically.We needed it to fit in a small space and it fit perfectly on a small table.The set up was very easy, and we were able to get everything connected to the app. From the box to operational was a matter of 10/15 minutes. We are very happy with this printer and the value was very good."
246,5,Good printer for home,"So far so good, it is a good printer for home. I got this for my daughter she is in college and she prints stuff sometimes our old printer was not keeping up anymore. Highly recommended."
247,5,"Good printer, value for money.",
248,5,Best Printer Fit for any home,Of all the printers I have and have had this one is my favorite.  I love that the paper is loaded in the front. There is simple instructions to follow in the booklet as well as the touch screen. At times when I became somewhat confused about something HP made it simple by my calling their customer service which gave se simple instructions and answers right away.  Any time I buy printers I can always count on HP but this 8015e printer is truly the best and you best believe I have tried ALOT of them
249,5,Was the easiest setup possible,"Wore out my other HP and ordered this wireless.  Read the reviews about problems others had, but had no problems at all.  Worked like magic!  Very happy."
250,1,Unreliable and Repeated Connection Issues that have No Solution,"I have never wanted to run over a piece of technology with a truck as much as I do with this printer. The print quality and speed are ideal for home use, WHEN it works, but that's only been about 50 percent of the time I've owned it.I was looking forward to using this printer with an instant ink subscription (advertised as being included for a few months for free), as I've used that with past hp printers I've owned. Unfortunately, I was NEVER able to redeem the free months of instant ink because the printer wouldn't allow me to set up and connect it to my wifi when I first received it. I spent literal hours on the phone with hp support, which resulted in exactly NO actual help. They ultimately told me that because my internet connection was a mobile hotspot that it was too unstable to support the printer. Ironically, my other hp printer always ran exclusively on the same mobile hotspot and there is a tower a mile down the road from my call carrier, meaning I always have 5 bars of 5G on my cell service so unstable connection is definitely NOT the issue.At some point, the printer decided to connect using a concoction of multiple cell phones, each with a specific set of bluetooth, mobile hotspot, wifi, and the very stupid hp ""smart"" app. It worked for months flawlessly. At times I had my mobile hotspot turned off and it would reconnect with no issue at all. Printed great (though photo quality always looks a bit off color-wise to me). I paid for instant ink for months and everything ran smoothly.Then, for no apparent reason, I'd go to use the printer one day and the touchscreen would just say ""cartridge cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP instant ink"" ...even though the instant ink subscription was still very much current and active. IF the printer would connect to the internet, it would have registered that information, however, there is NO way to exit that message screen to get it to connect to the internet again. No back button, no home button, nothing at all on the touchscreen. HP support recommended turning the printer off, unplugging it, and trying again. Spent hours trying and just received the same message. This happens every few months. I then go weeks, or months without use of the printer before it randomly begins working again, only to have the same problem several weeks down the road.I finally gave up on the instant ink and purchased genuine hp ink for the printer, to the tune of $80 or something ridiculous since the error message seemed related to the ink subscription, hoping that I could then at least get it to connect to the internet and function again. Incredibly, after installing the brand new cartridges and restarting everything yet again, the printer printed out an alignment page but showed a message that it couldn't scan it properly so setup wasn't complete. It then showed a screen that I need to go to 123.hp com to complete setup...which takes me to a page that requires downloading hp smart to my phone (it's already there) then the hp smart app gives me setup options for adding a new printer or setting one up that's already connected to the internet. But since this one is STILL NOT in wifi connection mode (and again, not giving ANY way to do that from the printer) the app can't find the printer, won't connect using wifi direct printing, won't offer me any other options from the app OR the printer screen.So, now it's Christmas. I'm trying to print a photo of my daughter's dog for a memorial ornament she requested after he died this year and I've spent 4 hours over the past 2 days just trying to print this ONE photo because my $170 printer is, in fact, just a giant, obnoxious paper weight. I've spent an additional $80 on ink, despite still actively paying for instant ink (and having entire, brand new cartridges from instant ink sitting right beside my printer) and this thing won't connect to my perfectly functional internet because it WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A WIFI CONNECTION OPTION.Could not be more frustrated and disappointed in this product. Print speed and quality is entirely irrelevant if the printer doesn't even give you a way to access the internet connection setup screen and therefore, literally will not function in any capacity."
251,1,"Not So Free Ink, Weak Wi-Fi","I Got this printer to replace an old Canon that stopped working after 10 years. One reason for picking this printer was the ""free"" 6 months of ink. Well, I needed to call tech support just to set the printer up. The tech support person wanted to install HP software on my computer. Now I know the difference between software and drivers, and I told tech support that I did not need software just drivers. After some back and forth the tech finally relented and helped me install just drivers and no HP bloatware. After the tech finished helping me with the drivers the printer needed to go through a registration process to activate my ""free"" ink. As part of the process of registering the printer I was told that I should keep the printer turned on all the time. All was well and good until about a week later when I turned the printer back on. The printer wanted to start the activation process all over again. I was able to get the printer back online without tech support this time and it stayed activated after that even though I turn my printer off when not in use. about 2 months later I get my ""free"" ink in the mail, right on time because the original cartridges are going empty after only 20 or 30 pages. I installed the new cartridges, and the printer worked well for another 3 and a half months. At about the 5 and a half month point I get an email saying my ""free"" ink period is about to expire, now I have printed about 50 pages over the 6-month period. I went to the HP ink web page and canceled my $5.99 a month subscription ( a week later they sent me an email informing me that the price was increased to $6.99 a month), and that is when I was informed that if I cancel my ink subscription my printer cartridges will be turned off, and now my ""free"" ink is USELESS and my printer will not print until I replace the full ink cartridges, and a new set of cartridges for the printer will cost About $85.00UpdateAfter I replaced all of the ink cartridges, and turned my printer back on again it said it needed to be set up again. Well now this is the third or fourth time I need to do the initial set up. I call tech support (time to start a paper trail) and ""we"" discover that the printer has dropped its IP address. The tech insists that there is a problem with my switch/router causing the issues. A couple of weeks later the same thing happens again, and again I am on the phone with tech support, and they say I have internet issues. When I ask why all of my other devices work and only my HP printer drops its IP address every couple of weeks they dance with the question. A couple of days later a rep from tech support called me and said that they want to replace the printer.When I received the new printer, I was able to set it up without any issues. Two weeks later I turned on the printer and it said setup needed, and there is no IP address in the printer. I called tech support, and again they blamed the issue on my internet. I was told that the printer would work better if I used a network cable instead of Wi-Fi. When I explained to the tech support rep that the printer was WIFI only (no Ethernet port) he suggested that the printer was too far (15 feet) from the router and that it had to be within 10 feet of the router. When I asked the rep how weak signal would cause the printer to lose its IP address, he could not answer the question but insisted that I would need to get up from my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it and walk into the next room to turn on my printer, then walk back to my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it to send the print job to the printer, and again walk back to the printer to retrieve the printed documents from the printer that is nice and comfy snuggled in right next to my Wi-Fi router.Now when I turn my new Brother printer on it says ready to print every time."
252,1,RUN! DO NOT PURCHASE,"Our household has always relied on Canon products, which have served us well over the years. However, in April 2024, we decided to take a chance on an HP All-in-One printer because of a promotional offer that included three months of ink supplies. This decision has turned out to be one of the most frustrating experiences in my history of printer purchases.Since purchasing the HP printer, I have yet to successfully use it. The printer refuses to stay connected to any device, making it impossible to print anything of value. Despite countless troubleshooting attempts, the only thing it has successfully printed is the HP instruction page — and now, the initial ink supply is completely depleted.I reached out to HP customer support, but the experience was equally disappointing. During my first call, the agent informed me that my printer wasn’t compatible with my internet and claimed I needed to purchase a firewall for $200, $400, or $600, depending on the coverage period. When I expressed my doubts and requested an American agent for clearer communication, my call was disconnected.On my second attempt, the agent recommended that I purchase a newer HP printer with no upfront cost and a $12.99 monthly payment plan. When I declined and asked to speak to a manager, I was placed on hold — only for the call to be disconnected once again. During my third call, the agent bluntly stated there was nothing they could do, as I should have contacted HP earlier in April, despite my ongoing issues since the purchase.When I turned to Amazon for support, I was informed that my warranty had expired. I tried explaining the ongoing nature of the issue, but both HP and Amazon refused to take responsibility. This lack of accountability from two major companies has been extremely frustrating.This entire experience has reaffirmed my loyalty to Canon. For over 15 years, Canon products have never let me down, offering reliability and excellent performance. In stark contrast, HP has failed to meet even the most basic expectations. I strongly recommend avoiding HP products entirely. Take the time to research other brands that value and support their customers.Additionally, my frustration with Amazon’s declining customer service has prompted me to reconsider my reliance on their platform. I am gradually shifting my purchases to competitors and encouraging my family to do the same. Amazon's services have noticeably deteriorated in recent years, and this experience with HP has further highlighted their shortcomings."
253,1,HPos Again,"This is at least my 5th HP printer. The 7400, 8500, and now this 8015 All are a nightmare to set up. This 8015 has some PIA features, that I had to call C.S to get handled.The reason I bought this is my O.S is Win7pro Svc pk1. I know it is old, however the irony of this is that the Printer will not recognize my router password due to Network being a WPA2 it only will accept WPA which is as old as my O.S! So no Handshake unless I turn my network into WPA and then maybe I can get it on my Network.My other Laptop is Win10 and the drivers installed fine but cannot see it on the Network when looking for Device>Printer. Due to Web search and learning WPA info aforementioned and why it will not accept my Router Pword, just gives Error.It does however Print wireless via a short code the Printer offers and then to fill in a blank at driver install time. After MAKING me get a MICROs___t email box. . .Ughh.To be honest, It is such a task to install an HP printer and now they do not even include a .50 cent DVD with the drivers. Nope, they want you to go to 123.HP to then get an installer which gave me two errors and had to system restore to get the Hook out of my O.S to throw it in the trash as the version it gave me at the site says my O.S is not new enough albeit Win7 SvcPk1 that is a Minimum.I will take a day off as computers are such a time suck for something that was supposed to be a time saver. See if I need to downgrade my security WPA2 to WPA, give it the Router PWord and then see if the BASIC Driver pkg will be acceptable and then go see if the Win10 Laptop will connect again after down grading the Security on that one too and see if it does not invalidate the code used when generated via Printer Window>Settings and then filled into at driver install. Pathetic.I did sign up for the HP+ which is really a spy for firmware upgrades, (we all know how those turn out) and the ink deal as I really only print a few shipping labels a month or a Movie script twice a year. Which is when they will hose me for per page prints. However 130 for ink cartridges that dry out the subscription is better FWIW. My hands were tied due to O.S on this one, not many Win7 compatible printers leftUPDATE Almost a Year owning it and I have not used it Once. I print a PDF and take it to work to print what I need. Every time I go to use it, It wants to re install and be on the Network just to make a PhotoCopy! RUN! This is another Huge PoS from HP.o.s."
254,1,***This Machine is a Key Part of HP’s latest SCAM****,"Buyer BEWARE!!! This may apply to all HP printers, but HP has been on a quest to force those who buy their printers to use “genuine HP toner.”  In the past, their machines could detect when a “non HP” cartridge was being used, but this just generated warnings about the quality of non-genuine cartridges being dubious, and the machine would not detect the toner level for you (when it was probably quite capable of doing so).Fine, I don’t fault HP for wanting to sell its own toner. However, I also didn’t want to pay for HP’s toner at twice or triple the cost of competitor’s toner, which worked just as well and seemed to last just as long as the “genuine” cartridges. Well, HP has significantly stepped up its efforts to monopolize the toner sales now…After my last modestly used HP print/scan/fax device suddenly stopped working (very curiously at that, as the failure seemed more software based than mechanical), I bought this machine as an economical replacement. I also immediately bought some 3rd party toner replacements in the proper size. I’m setting up this printer, I declined the toner subscription service as before. When the starter toner ran out, that’s when I discovered that HP was taking things to another level…I popped in the 3rd party cartridge, expecting the machine to chastise me for using “non-genuine” toner but ultimately letting me proceed. However, unlike before, the machine literally refused to print, displaying a message to that effect on the screen and stating that it was due to the non-HP cartridge. It would not use the non-genuine cartridge. Needless to say, I was pi$$ed off that I couldn’t print something I really needed to—and that HP was now literally forcing my hand to use their overpriced toner (not just pressuring me to as in the past).Naturally, the printer was now past the 30-day return window. I was also past the return window on the 3rd party toner cartridges. Feeling screwed, I proceeded to enroll in HP’s “instant ink” program—under duress—while I decide what to do longer term, as I definitely don’t want another monthly subscription for anything on my credit card (much less for printer toner!!).So get this, as soon as I processed the subscription and HP had me locked into buying their toner, my print job printed!  Yes, with the 3rd party cartridge. Printed perfectly too compared to the print jobs from the genuine cartridges that came with the printer. I have received the first order of genuine ink but still have the 3rd party cartridge installed. So it wasn’t a compatibility issue AT ALL. HP just now has its machines programmed to be paper weights unless you are actively subscribed to buy their toner!!!!"
255,1,Do NOT buy!! HP+ Printer as a Service has no business in a home!! The Big Brother of Printers!,"I've had HP printers for as long as I can remember. When my last all-in-one finally stopped working I decided on the HP8015e thinking I was getting a solid reliable printer/scanner at a very decent price. But I was wrong! You are required to sign up for the monthly HP+ subscription program that includes ink for 6 months (for me) - and paper if you like (rip-off) and are limited to a set number of printouts a month or you are charged extra. It doesn't matter if you buy paper from Target any printouts count towards your quota - ""any paper with measurable ink deposited"". And forget about using anything other than HP ink. It just won't work. Your printer becomes a brick - HP only.With kids in school, printouts could be 10 a week, or 100, depending on the projects. The wifi connection was always spotty and constantly going offline since there was no ethernet port to connect with - though other wifi devices had strong signals. The overhanded big brother approach was very unnerving with constant connectivity required.I just wanted a printer/scanner/copier that I could use for kids school work and home office work without a company keeping tabs on the number of pages I'm printing or the kind of ink I use - and continuously charging my account. If my printer gets low on ink, I'll go buy more. If it gets low on paper I'll buy more. I don't need the stress of subscription time limits with a freaking printer. IT'S A PRINTER!HP needs to get real and decide what type of business model they really want to have. I wonder what kind of data they are collecting from the recipes I'm printing? Who are they going to sell any data they collect from how their printers are being used?My new research says to go with Lexmark or Brother with the latter being more favorable. The choice is up to you, but don't say you weren't warned if you go with HP - you can't jailbreak it. You just have to break it and get something else.Oh, if you stayed this long, I ended up recycling the printer after a few hits with a bat and ripping out any circuit boards I could find. It couldn't be reset to factory settings and I couldn't delete my HP+ account. I ended up removing everything HP related from my PC and will never purchase anything from that company again.Good luck!"
256,1,Absolute waste of money,"This is by far the worst printer or piece of equipment in general I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing.Everything worked fine for a few weeks, but once the ink ran out everything went to hell.  I used to have a Canon printer which worked great for several years but decided I needed to ""upgrade"" to something newer and thought the reviews looked great for this printer on amazon.  Little did I know that HP HAS ABSOLUTE DOG-WATER REVIEWS WORLDWIDE FOR THEIR PRINTERS AND THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT HERE ON AMAZON ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.I'd like to point out that I'm no slouch when it comes to technology.  I have built my own computers on several occasions, have several degrees in linguistics from accredited institutions with a decade of experience, and operate 3D printers on the regular for various needs.  I didn't think purchasing a document printer needed much research.  I was absolutely wrong. I have never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment than I have with this printer - so much so that I am writing a detailed review for the first time in years.Here are the more salient details:-Will not accept ink that is not made by HP which costs about twice as much as other ink. Other printers allow it just fine.  Not HP.-In the past, HP would let you ""disable cartridge protection"" on the printer itself which would allow you to use generic ink brands.  Not anymore.-You can log into your device on a computer to disable cartridge protection, though.  It still doesn't allow you to use generic ink, though, so it's pointless.-You will be practically forced to download the ""HP smart"" app which is just a slow and barely functioning app that will hit you with an add every 2 minutes pressuring you to SUBSCRIBE TO A MONTHLY INK SUBSCRIPTION.  Like, there's greed, then there's this.  Imagine buying a car only to find out you're only allowed to buy gas at a specific gas station that sells gas for twice the price.This is just a snippet of my problem with this piece of trash.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MATERIAL."
257,1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","I will never buy any HP product ever again. Bought this printer. Worked for about 3 weeks and then would not print again.The printer feels like very poor quality plastic. I am being told by customer service that I cannot adjust the paper tray so that the paper does not slide backwards for regular sized legal paper. The printer has a very cheap feel to it. Also hard to open paper tray, it opens slightly and then needs a good hard tug to open it completely. Very poor design and quality.I called customer service. We spent over 50 minutes to get it to work again.I found customer service to be horrible. Have spoken to several people in customer service and have found them, in general, to be argumentative. Had several issues where they would ask me for information repeatedly that I had already given them. Nobody seems to listen. Very hard to solve issues when they keep forgetting what you have already told them.I was promised a call back the next day at 11:00am, it is now 6:20pm the following day and I have still not received said call back. What I have found most annoying about customer service is the amount of contradictions in answers, the ARGUMENTATIVE nature of representatives, the lack of listening and comprehending of issues, the TALKING OVER ME and general LACK OF UNDERSTANDING of what is being communicated and attempted REDIRECTION from the questions being asked. Rarely in my life have I experienced such BAD ATTITUDE from any company.After not receiving my previous promised call I called in again. Was promised a 8:00am call the next day. I expressed my skepticism about receiving that call given their promise to call me back last time and then not doing so. I was promised high and low that this time would be different. SURPRISE, well actually it wasn't a surprise. They did not call back this time either. The way customer service treats their customers is awful.After not being able to print and spending over 50 minutes getting that resolved I now have a new problem. I have another error message stating that the paper tray is open even though it is not. Once again I am unable to print anything.It is very hard to take customer service reps and their supervisors seriously when they contradict themselves don't listen to you and don't execute on their promises.In general, I think they have a serious attitude problem in customer service. Pity they do not give us the option to give them a 0 star rating."
258,1,"Please, save yourself/marriage/family, don't buy this.","This is not a printer - it's a paper and ink holder.The printer won't wirelessly print (which I think is the only way this thing can print since they have a ""no USB"" sticker over the USB port).  Printer thinks it's connected to my WiFi (yay!), my laptop sees it on the network (yay!), but the HP Dashboard and App says it's not (boo!) and when I ""print"" nothing happens (womp womp).  I'm not a dumb dumb - I even spent about 90 minutes on the phone with support a few months ago in which they said they think it has something to do my account being associated with the Instant Ink, but the printer not knowing that or whatever.  I've restarted everything, re-added the printer on the app to no avail.  So just decided to cancel the Instant Ink so I can remove the printer from my account.  It's now canceled, but the Dashboard still says it's not (but the Instant Ink page definitely says it's canceled), so I still can't remove the printer from the Account in an attempt to re-add it.  So it's just a brick...or cinderblock.I've had a bunch of other headaches - like called support and spent about 10 minute, the lady asked if I had a Mac or Windows and I told her I set it up on my Android phone but insisted that support can only help with a Mac OS or Windows, so I told her I have a Mac Laptop and she told me it was the wrong department, transferred me, and I got to listen to hold music for another 10 minutes.When the printer worked, it was great.  Good quality, no complaints.  It has a fun app that lets me print off coloring sheets for my kids to color.But you can tell that HP doesn't want me dating other ink re-sellers.  I cancelled the Instant Ink and I have a week to buy ink (even though the cartridges in the printer are about 80% full) because they're going to not let the printer use those cartridges...which in a way doesn't matter since I can't use the printer anyway, but still, very wasteful and insecure of them.Anyway, there's a bunch of other printers out there, so why add extra stress in your life by buying an HP who want you for your Instant Ink subscription and not because they want to bring happiness into your life when you can provide your kids a fun coloring sheet in 1 minute. You can do better and purchase from countless other brands."
259,1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I bought this printer in August of 2023 for home office use. I thought I was just getting a printer that I could purchase ink for and use as I PAID FOR THE PRINTER! Instead, I found myself enrolled in a subscription ink program. I was billed every month for INK I DID NOT RECEIVE! When I caught the subscription for a product I wasn't receiving I notified HP--thinking they would refund my money for cartridges never received and help me understand how to unenroll from the subscription program. Instead I was challenged that I really was receiving the ink and just trying to get out of paying for it--and after I cancelled the subscription my printer was made unusable by HP with a message on my printer stating ""The indicated cartridges cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP Instant Ink.""  This message again prompted me to connect with HP to no avail. No response. No help. ZERO resolution to this ridiculous situation rendering my printer useless. I cannot emphasize enough--DO NOT BUY this printer. I am rethinking all my HP purchases now--I have two personal laptops and a business laptop that are all HP. Bad service equals bad products. BANNING HP from my house and office."
260,1,Not good,"i connected this to my computer wirelessly which seems to be the only option.  Then 2 months after the warranty expired it came up on my screen that a critical driver needed updated and it would be updating.  But it won't update because it is now disconnected from wifi for some reason and since the notice is the only thing on the printer screen there is no way to reconnect it because that is done through the printer with that screen.  There are no buttons to push or anything to get the notice off of the screen.  I tried uninstalling, unplugging etc.  It comes back up on the screen and no way to get rid of it.  So basically the computer is worthless to me at this point.  I don't think I would go with HP again. I also had a problem with one of their techs when i called for service.  He wanted access to my computer to try to figure out what the problem was with the computer so I gave his screen access.  He then told me my computer was corrupted so that's why my printer wasn't working  and wanted to sell me software to take care of it and he would run it on my computer for me.  I told him I wasn't interested and I would prefer to take it to someone locally.  He became very insistent and upset that i wouldn';t let him install it.  I turned off the screen sharing immediatly and he had really goofed up my computer on purpose it seems so he could sell me the software.  Don't trust hp techs to look at your screen by screen sharing."
261,1,Mickey Mouse trash,
262,1,"Does not work, incapable of printing when needed","I have had this printer for awhile at this point and I can say with 100%, do not buy it. It routinely tells me on the screen my WiFi signal is not good, I go into the settings of the printer and it says WiFi signal excellent. The printer also never wants to print when sending a document to print. Either nothing happens or it prints and 9/10 times nothing happens. In the rare chance it prints the first time I will continue to get a pop up on my phone saying, the printer is busy and click try again or cancel, this pop up happens as I am watching it print what I just sent to the printer.I beg of you to not purchase this printer it will only give you headaches.The ink life is abysmal on this printer, I am able to printer around 20 pages and it’s telling me I am out of int… I am shocked with the price you pay for this ink in general.I would have returned this printer but by the time I actually needed to print something it was out of the Amazon return window.Overall this printer is probably the most useless item sitting in my office at the moment. Constantly having to restart the device to make it work, buying more ink to print out another 20 pages, and for the fact the WiFi on the device is disappointing. Please do not buy unless you want fo be angry all the time and contemplate taking a sledgehammer to your printer."
263,1,Very difficult to install,"I have had a very difficult time installing this printer. I used HP Smart for the installation and still had to use HP Print and Scan Doctor to get it to print. HP smart does not install the scan feature correctly and I had to use a different installation option to get ""scan to computer"" to work. I spent a total of 15 hours getting this printer set up so I could both print and scan to my computer. This included uninstalling and reinstalling twice. Approximately the fifth page I actually printed, it got a severe paper jam. After clearing it, I had to go through the complete set-up procedure again. I hope that this is not necessary every time i have to shut the printer down to clear a paper jam. The paper tray and printed outlet tray are very fragile and difficult to align. I would not recommend this printer to my worst enemy. There should be a place for negative stars (black holes??) on reviews because that is exactly what it would get from me."
264,1,SCAM! Don't waste your money.,"I originally purchased this printer for my classroom but took it home after I was unable to print using the school network.  I decided to keep this printer for home use and ordered a network compatible printer for my classroom. My original thought was, free ink for 6 months and a subscription that would send ink when I needed it would be great. I wasn't using the printer at home much so I cancelled the ink subscription because my trial was about to be up and I didn't feel that it would be worth the money. The day after I cancelled it would not let me print because I was no longer enrolled in instant ink. I reenrolled in instant ink to print one page and did the lowest monthly amount because I was told otherwise I would need to go purchase different ink cartridges at the store that were not the instant ink brand even though these were the almost completely full cartridges that came with the printer.Since I reenrolled and paid the monthly fee, I decided to print some things at home that I needed for the next week of school in my classroom and I went over my ""monthly subscription"" limit so I got an email stating that every XX number of pages I went over that I would be charged an additional $1.00 each month. I think it is outrageous and ridiculous that a subscription is required to continue using this printer and not only that if I print more than I'm paying for that I should be charged additional funds. If I run out of ink and don't want to pay extra for it, don't send the ink or better year don't require me to have a subscription on the ink cartridges that came with the printer even if they haven't ran out yet. Unfortunately I can no longer return the printer but hopefully I can save someone else the headache and annoyance of this shady product and brand."
265,1,If it works it’s a good printer.,"This printer had caused me much time and unnecessary stress.  I have spent so many hours on separate occasions with their tech support. After about half a year they replaced one for me because they couldn’t get it connected to the WiFi. Then the replacement printer went out as well. Today again I was on the phone with them, after a few weeks the printer disconnected from the WiFi. I was afraid to call because I knew that it will take a long time. Tech support treated me like I was a goldfish. More than five times he said I had input an incorrect password. Then he questioning if I had selected the incorrect  WiFi. At the end he told me he agreed that the printer is not going to work and wanted to send me a replacement for the replacement. I just unplugged the printer sent it to the garbage can and I don’t even want to set up for them to send a replacement."
266,1,Drivers will not work!! Don’t buy it!,"After working in IT for 10+ years I am always learning and sometimes you have research a fix for installation fails…but this piece of poop from HP takes the cake. After spending 4 hours plus reinstalling, reconfiguring wireless settings, selecting ever possible option, updating everything on a fairly new Dell laptop that use daily in the field working with all sorts of different scenarios…I’m convinced HP simply has NOT provided a fix for accessing drivers for this 8015e. First red flag was that it shows as 8010 series printer and the specific model of 8015e. There are chats that say the generic drivers won’t work (they should) and you have to uninstall and reinstall a few times with the right drivers…been there done that…but no matter how many times you reaquire, reinstall and config the printer…Windows 11 still says drivers not found even after they are manually installed.Probably an issue with Windows 10 and the HO drivers talking to each other…but HP really drops the ball not having a fix for this.Also, new printers do not have a USB drive port to manually install drivers, and also no Ethernet jack for hardwire connectivity. There is USB to laptop from printer port, but the printer should run 100% wireless.Epic waste of time. Hope this saves a home office worker some time.DO NOT BUY THIS!"
267,1,Never buying HP again,"If you are like me, you have a printer because maybe once a month you have things you need to print. Every other time I go to use this printer, it erases my wifi info and demands that I setup the printer through the HP app again from square one. Each time, you have to crack the secret code of button combinations to get past the warning message, so that you can enable wifi again. You have to connect to the HP app, sign in to your account and do a complete setup like you just bought the printer. Very convenient for HP that each time you do this, you get bombarded with offers for their subscription services that you cannot continue without searching for a way to decline.I've always bought HP printers, my past printers gave me zero issues. I had read that their sole existence is now to push subscriptions, but i guess i had to see it to believe it."
268,1,Had to return it.,"How does this have a 4 star rating? Please read the reviews, especially comments regarding connectivity issues. I've used HP since my very first printer, and I believe in brand loyalty when earned. Unfortunately, things appear to have changed. If you have hours to spend attempting to set it up and then more time to spend online with customer service, with no improvement, then I'd suggest giving it a shot.HP has gone very ""HP-centric"". You must use their app, their ink, etc. If you don't, it won't work as it's not compatible. This is on top of all of the connectivity issues. I have no idea how it actually works because, except for the test print sheet, I haven't a clue. This model has a little screen on it. Unfortunately, if iit doesn't connect to WiFi, you can't get past their screen demanding that you download their app for your phone/tablet to recognize it. No ""exit"", nothing. Just stuck on the screen with the Q code link on it. So, no help screens, nothing. You get to search the manual and other online resources to try and figure out what is happening. I received a refund, which of course Amazon said that if they refund the money to your Amazon account (instead of your bank card), you get it quickly. Otherwise, you wait. It wasn't quick enough to cover the new printer that I had to order, however. All around a very frustrating experience."
269,1,Beware of HP Customer Support,"I’m writing this review to warn other customers about HP support.  I bought this printer and upon setting it up I received a fatal error code which will C0000022  which directed me to call HP customer support. When calling customer support they immediately wanted to take over my computer to try to find the issue at first I objected and it took three calls before I finally conceive it so I let them go into my computer and they come back and say that my IP address has been compromised. I was told nothing was wrong with my computer or the printer, but my IP address had been compromised and I couldn’t upload the printer. The customer support agent told me in order to fix the problem it was gonna cost me $299 and they can repair, the problem with the compromise IP address. I told the customer representative that me paying $299 would not be happening after getting off the phone. I search the Internet for help and if I could receive help I was going to have to return the printer, and I finally came to the conclusion to upgrade the software on my  MacBook Air once I uploaded the software, I had no issues connecting the printer. So I’m just warning anyone who has a Mac and have problems connecting this printer try upgrading your software first and don’t pay HP support tax. Any money for what they say is a compromise IP address it’s a shame that HP is allowing their customer support representatives to scam unsuspecting customers. Had I agreed to pay the $299 I would have been doing so for them to simply upgrade my software so buyer beware!"
270,1,Not even 6 months,"The printer was just fine up until about two months ago. All of a sudden, it wouldn't connect to my computer. Literally five minutes after the last use. I had to re-set the network, that didn't work. I had to uninstall and reinstall. That worked for a little while. Then it wouldn't scan. Reboot computer and printer. Shortly thereafter, I had to re-set the network connection again. Fine, that took a bit. The printer just wasn't cooperating. Got that taken care of. All is fine for another two weeks. Printer is connected to the network, computer recognizes it. The HP Smart is working for scanning. The mobile HP App printed a document just fine. But I couldn't print from the computer. I cleaned out the print que. I rebooted, I checked for updates. I re-installed yet again. Can print from the computer and HP Smart on my phone. I go to HP smart to scan and it doesn't find the printer. I am SO done with this POS. I have lost so much productivity from this thing. And yay, now I get to buy another printer. Cuz I just have money laying around for this. Not.  I think I am going to buy a Canon or Epsom."
271,1,Don’t buy this and maybe try another brand,"I ordered this printer in October 2023 to replace the previous HP All in One I had that gave up the ghost in under 2 years. This is the 5th or 6th HP All in One I have had in the last 15 years. They have been getting increasingly shorter lived and more problematic. This one had to be replaced within 3 months due to a broken carriage that would not allow the thing in front of the ink to be moved. After no less than 2 days and over 5 hours of conversation between my spouse and me with HP support going through the same troubleshooting steps at least a half dozen times, they finally got that we had a broken printer that they replaced through warranty. I have had the new one since about December or January and it is the worst printer I have ever had and between this trouble and HP+, it makes me want to never buy an HP again. You cannot set it up and get it to print without using HP+ and the app. It also forgets everything you set up regularly and I have had to reset it up several times and this most recent time it still won’t print because it says the printer is busy and it thinks it is a different printer with the same name. I’m pretty savvy when it comes to technology but this printer and the HP app with the subscription are the pits. Super disappointing with the cost of this printer when I could have gotten a Lexmark for half the price. I will buy a Lexmark next time and hopefully it will prove to be better technology without the fuss and at significantly lesser cost."
272,1,Piece of JUNK!!,I got this printer as a Christmas gift for myself. Nothing but issues from day one.  Images are full of black or white lines. I called HP spent 4 hours on call with them.  Got it to work printed a few good pages and bam back to lines and images. Called tech aging they said printer ink jets need to be cleaned. ran through that three times. Still did not work. They said inkjets needed to be aligned did that. Guess what? No go!!  they had me run a test print. the test print said ink jet needs to be cleaned and aligned. They had me do it all aging. Guess what? Still did not work. Have not had this junk not even a month. They agree to send me a replacement.  I get it on the phone with them trying to get it set up and get it registered with my hp dash bord. That was a joke it said it was already registered under someone else's name. That still has not been fixed. While on the phone with them they control my PC and they can't even get the software to load. They finally get it to load do a test print. Guess what It is now having the same issues as the first one. It does it with them even controlling my PC same errors print heads need cleaned and alignment needs to be done. Now by this time there telling me nothing more they can do. All i can do is by a new one out of my own pocket. This company is a joke.
273,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER unless you are willing to always buy ink from HP.,"I bought this printer in April 2024. Then this happened:1.  WIth the purchase came three months of free HP ink service. Cool, right? At the end of the free trial, I canceled the automatic ink service because it was expensive and I knew I could get ink more cheaply than direct from HP.  The ink cartridges in my printer were still nearly full.  Even so, when I canceled my ink service and then tried to print something,  I received a message from my printer that the ink cartridges in the printer (from the free trial) could not be used once I canceled the service. So my printer wouldn't print.2. So I threw out the nearly full HP ink cartridges and bought some less expensive ones from Amazon. They arrived, I installed them, and for three days they printed fine.  Problem solved, right? NOPE.3. On the fourth day, I tried to print something and it wouldn't print again. Then I noticed another message from my printer, this one telling me that it won't print without authentic HP printer cartridges. Once again, I needed to print something, had nearly full ink cartridges, and couldn't print.By my count, HP hijacked my printer twice. I will NEVER, EVER buy an HP printer again.  If you do, just be prepared for the ink nightmare above. It's ridiculous but true."
274,1,Biggest mistake buying this product. Not worth the aggravation.,"Long story, TLDR: I got to use the printer for one project and the next 4 months were a series of problems.I bought this on sale and heard good things about the printer from friends and family. I got the printer and set it up pretty easily. I printed out about 20 pages on the starter ink and the Instant Ink sent me replacement ink. When it arrived some kids from the neighborhood had vandalized the package and destroyed the cartridge. (That's really no one's fault, I'm not even mad at the kids) The process for reordering the cartridges was extremely difficult and it took me a week of trying to get in touch with someone to send me more ink. When the ink finally arrived too late for the event that I needed it for I installed the cartridges. The next time I needed to print I received an error message that was on the screen for a brief moment and then the printer permanently shut down. (we're still only two months after purchase) The printer was unserviceable, but still under factory warrantee, so they sent me a new printer. When setting up the new printer, they told me to keep the cartridges for the replacement. I couldn't remove the cartridges unless the printer was on, so I had to track down customer service again for more ink. When the cartridges finally arrived, the printer gives me a message that says it wanted me to insert the ""starter cartridges that came with the printer"". I'm leaving a few steps out of that story because there were so many minor problems that it would be impossible for you to follow everything. I'm cutting my losses. Worst printer I've ever own. Worst service I've ever had. I cannot overstate how bad my experience with this printer was."
275,1,Wasted 5 Hours of My Time,"I have always purchased HP products.  I have a pretty new HP desktop computer and it is great!  My HP printer that I have had for 15 or more years has been acting up so I decided to upgrade.  I spent 2 hours trying to connect this printer to my PC.  It would connect to the internet, but would not connect to my computer through the wireless network.  The next day, I contacted HP tech support and they walked me through the steps (which I had already done 5 or more times), which took 1 hr 40 min. and they had the same problem, so they decided to access my computer and try to fix the problem from there.  2 more hours later I gave up and boxed this thing up and will be returning.  Connected an HP printer to an HP computer should be seamless.  I decided to go with a different brand that can be hooked up via USB if the wireless fails.  This HP printer only has the option to hook up via WiFi, so there is no option for USB or Bluetooth hookup in case the WiFi does not cooperate.  I am so disappointed with this purchase as well as HP Tech Support (which has nothing do with Amazon).  I would not recommend this printer."
276,1,I went though hell to try and get this printer to work.,"There was nothing to like about this product. I was replacing it with an older HP printer that worked fine until my system turned to 5G. Mysteriously it stopped working after a couple months and HP was not standing behind this product anymore with new drivers. I bought this new unit, and none of my computers would recognize the printer My newer iPhone had the same problem . I spent hours on it myself trying to figure it out. I then used the tech services over the Internet. That woman took control of my computer for around an hour and a half and abruptly said it’s done and disconnected with me. It’s still didn’t work. On the second time with a tech I use a phone call. That lasted for over two hours. The whole time I was on the phone with this clown who I could barely understand, the phone cutting out losing connection with him. After about 10 or 15 times of this, asked my wife if I could use her phone and he could call me on that.  Her phone did the same thing. While I am on her phone,  I asked her to call someone on my phone. She talked with that person for over 15 minutes with no cut outs. Eventually the guy kinda got my first computer to recognize the unit and then he disappeared , I went to my second computer, it’s still will not work. I’m done at this point. I almost have to wonder if all those cutting in and out of my phone line which was probably over 20 times was nothing more than harassment from this tech on the other end, because I’ve had no trouble with my phone since hanging up from that person. His rudeness, and beginning unable to answer any of my questions at one of the worst  customer service experiences I’ve been through"
277,1,Cheap POS Printer - No Stars,"This HP printer was a big disappointment.  I purchased this for low volume home wireless printing.  From the start, the printer paper jammed each time; and sometimes it would print 3 or 4 pages when only 1 copy was selected.  Removing the flimsy cover and paper tray each time, realigning the paper and then pushing them back in the printer was frustrating and a waste of time.  As I had thrown away the packing box it was not returnable, so it was thrown in the trash.  A complete waste of money and time.  I do not mean to criticize HP products in general but this particular model was a bust.  I had to rate this 1 star but would rate is NO STARS if that was an option."
278,1,Worst purchase ever,"Constantly ""offline"", disconnecting from my router, not able to find the router or connect to the router; requires installing HP smart app for printer setup, but then repeatedly getting error message on the printer that it was not set up in the HP app (even though it clearly was - but showing ""offline""). Performed HP troubleshooting in the app, it reported that there were NO issues found.  And to be clear, my router was NOT the problem. I finally got fed up but missed the 30-day return window since the majority of issues started happening about 40 days after purchase. Do NOT buy this printer. I ended up buying an Epson and it is awesome - no ""smart app"" required, no connection issues, ZERO problems. The HP is going on the curb."
279,1,"Do Not sign up for ""instant ink""!","Other than the fact the Amazon price has dropped $60 since I bought it, the cheap plastic paper tray and guide have to be jiggled as they snag on each other, and when I went online (at HPs suggestion) to get my Chromebox to work with the printer and was advised I'd have to first download an app to my phone to make this happen (not true) while being pressured to sign up for the ""instant ink"" program because if I don't use HP cartridges my printer will stop working (hopefully not true, time will tell...) it's a great product. A bit of research will reveal HP is being sued over their ink scam and why you should NOT agree to firmware updates when prompted...research I wish I had done. Good luck."
280,1,Will forever not recommend HP now,"Worst functionality. The first one arrived with a defective ink track. Second one came from HP and found out it has a speck of a flaw on the automatic document feeder lens that causes a line down the entire page when copying. I've created a case about this issue and followed up on this issue, no response at all from HP in over a month. Difficulty initially to set up the wireless and intermittently have trouble with that. Lastly, I canceled the Instant Ink subscription since we had the 2nd ink cartridges that came with the 2nd printer and then 1 set that came out from the subscription. We didn't need any for a while, so why pay. Apparently, you can't even print from your PC without the subscription. It says the indicated cartridges cannot be used until enrolled. It also will not allow us to use the 2nd set that came with the 2nd printer because it recognizes it as a ""setup"" cartridge and forces the refills to be used. This is the most restrictive device I've ever owned. Will forever badmouth HP for it now."
281,1,Do NOT buy this printer. EVER. Don't even think about it. Just move on.,"This printer bricks itself every few days. Yes, i connected to HP+ account and pay for instant ink. but that doesn't matter when the printer disconnects itself from my HP account and tells me I need to 'Complete Setup' EVERY TIME I GO TO PRINT SOMETHING. This time I am unable to reconnect it to my account as it just says it has a technical error. Now it is truly a brick. What a piece of complete junk. I want to throw it outside and beat it repeatedly with a bat. I thought that was all a joke until i got this printer. Worst printer I have ever owned or used. Why? Because you can't print anything on it!!! Throw your $100 straight in the trash, you will be much happier than having bought this printer and wasted 48 hours trying to get it to work only to then buy a different printer."
282,1,Poorly designed paper tray.,"This would be fine if you never print photos.  I was looking for an all round printer and was very disappointed that the paper tray practically needed to be disassembled to change out the paper types. I seriously didn’t realize it has only one tray that you need to completely empty and readjust to accommodate photo paper. My old HP had what I thought was only one tray but had a little slide out shelf within it that held the photo paper. I’m the dummy that didn’t realize they call that two trays. Forget that the paper stop as it’s coming out of the printer has to be manually pulled out or your pages hit the floor. I’m generally not at the printer when I hit “print” so this was a surprise. My old on popped out on its own. It also cropped my  pictures, apparently to fit although on the preview it was perfect and the setting all checked out. I thought I could live with the smaller info screen but I was used to a larger one and trust me……bigger is better!  I will say however that the color was great. Hated it, sent it back! Not sure about teck support, maybe they could have helped with the cropping issue, I found no help on line , but most of my issues were design flaws and I’d lost all patients to even attempt to get through the AI chat bot to get a real person. I still love HP products and will do a better search in the future."
283,1,Broke in 3 months and only worked once with jams,"BOTTOM LINE: After talking to ""support"", I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to just shell out the cash for a better printer or just not to get a printer in the first place.While this printer was easy to set up, it is a piece of junk. The parts are flimsy, don't fit well, and overall, the lack of quality is appalling. Even more so now that I've spent 4 hours of my life troubleshooting, stuck on the phone with Amazon, and now with HP AND Amazon. I had to ""clean printer head"" (something I did prior to even calling in cuz I'm not an idiot) - not once! not twice! but SIX times! - Fun fact: it gets longer every time you do it!! The cherry on this terrible cake is I'm no closer to having an actual solution than 4 hours ago. Best case scenario since nothing has worked is that they send me these new cartridges that may or may not fix the problem, they don't fix the problem, and then they send me another one of these pieces of you know what, so I still end up with the world's shoddiest printer. LONG EXASPERATED SIGH."
284,1,Buy an HP OfficeJet Printer & get the paywall for free! (whether you want it or not),"This purchase was a horrible choice! Setting up the printer is way to many steps all because HP wants you to buy there overpriced ink. Everything about the printer is built around that. I have refilled my ink cartridges but everytime I do so I have to make sure to avoid some update on the firmware. This should be easy enough but they find a way to sneak in an update which registers the refill. After not updating the firmware for a few months if you ever disconnect the printer or have a power outage you will have to go through resetting it up again and jumping through a bunch of hoops to be able to use your refills or 3rd party ink. I have wasted hours connecting, reconnecting, updating, troubleshooting and tinkering with this printer. Please save yourself the headache and avoid HP printers all together. Im not even 6 months into owning this printer and Im already scarred for life with printer PTSD."
285,1,ink depletes very rapidly,"May i add that after i gave this review, i had installed more cartridges. My husband and i really don't use a whole lot of in. Yet, yesterday, again, i got a message  that the print cartridge was low.  hat the ink the printer came with would last 3 months is totally inaccurate. I had to buy the black ink one month after purchase, and a few days later now i noticed all the other ink cartridges are low as well. Something is wrong there. I shouldn't have to buy ink that soon. DisappointinAlso, i asked for help as i needed some assistance for the scanning. Very complicated to use in scanning pdfs.i cannot say i am impressed so far. It basically works ok. That's all."
286,1,Faulty advertising and Defective Product,"The page on Amazon listed two options, current model or previous model. I selected current model. After trying to install the current model unsuccessfully myself and failing, I called HP Support. They were unable to install the product. Also, the agent stated it was NOT the current model.There was also a problem with the delivery. I was supposed to receive it Saturday. I received an email from Amazon stating the next day (Saturday). On Saturday, I was tracking it on Amazon. I saw that it hadn't been  shipped yet. I called Amazon about the issue. The agent called logistics. They told him that it had been damaged during shipping. He would have one delivered the next morning early. I reminded the agent that it was to be packaged in another box because otherwise the product would be exposed. He said he would make sure. Instead, it was delivered in original packaging (people could see what the product was). It has been an horrendous experience all around."
287,1,Do Not Buy the HP OfficeJet 8010 -It seems like a scam,
288,1,"Junk.  Can't be run without having the troubleshooter run first, EVERYTIME!","This printer has never run well.  We called HP several times and they had us go in the phone circle for over an hour.We had to have a contract for ink, and HP MONITORS what is printed and when.There is not ONE good thing I can say about this machine.For the most part, I have to e-mail my print jobs to my work address, and print it there, or send it to my wifes e-mail and have her print it.  This machine is the worst I have ever seen.Do Not Buy it.  You will not get any support.  I wish I could return it, but that isn't allowed either.  Even though it is a problem with the mechanics, they will not honor it.You've been warned."
289,1,Terrible printer,"Prior to recently purchasing this printer, I had another HP printer that lasted 8 years and it was awesome. It finally died, so I got this one. It's been trouble from day one. It goes ""offline"" regularly, prompting me to start the set-up process from scratch each time, which may or may not work, taking way too much time. The ink cartridges, which were very easy to replace in my last HP, always get error messages after installation, and it jams regularly. It also squeaks and makes noises like it's about to die. This printer is a huge disappointment and I will be returning it. Don't waste your money on this one."
290,1,"Not just this one, ALL HP printers","How arrogant of HP to pigeon hole consumers into only being able to use their ink cartridges. We do not print that many color pages, but have had to order new ink every 2 months over the last year. Since I refuse to add another subscription to my life, that means we were spending $60 every two months. I decided to purchase off brand cartridges this time. The printer will not even work with off brand cartridges. That is absolutely ridiculous. I should be able to choose if I want name brand or not. So guess what, have having HP printers only for 20 years, I will never purchase from them again. They have certainly lost a customer because of their decisions to require only HP cartridges being used in a consumable product!"
291,1,One page per cartridge,I have never in my life been so upset with a piece of machinery. Save your money and buy a brother color toner printer instead. You will also save a bunch of headaches. You either have to pay for the top tier hp printer ink and have their service and agree to all their terms to keep your printer even working. Then on top of that it blows through ink trying to print one page correctly. I can barely get through anything for a homeschool preschooled child's work before it runs out of one of the cartridges. This is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever used.
292,1,"Scam, you have to connect it to internet and maintain account to use it",
293,1,If I could have given it zero stars I would have,"I've had this piece of garbage for a little over a year now and I swear every single time I go to print or do anything with it it has a problem either connection errors or just refusing to print or the document feeder doesn't work right or you name it whatever the problem is it's going to have one as soon as you need to use it at least that is my experience so if you may love this thing I do not at all have any love for this item to me it's junk. It is by no means a work horse I hardly ever use it between that and the app that you have to use to use it and it's constant disconnecting and not sending information to get your instant ink and then the customer service I don't even want to go into that, HP you have fallen from Grace"
294,1,Do not buy this printer!,"This has been an extremely disappointing purchase. I have owned several Hp printers over the years and have never experienced the  poor customer service or had such a frustrating experience with a printer. It worked okay for a couple of months, then stopped printing. The error message was that I needed to complete the setup. I have contacted customer service three times to resolve the issue.Twice I allowed customer service to have access to my computer. Neither time was the representative able to solve the problem, and in fact seemed to be more interested in selling me a security program. Yesterday I spent 2 hours on a customer service chat and followed all of the directions given to me. the printer still would not print and I received the same error messages I had received before. After 2 hours the representative disconnected the call and sent an email stating that the case was closed as if he/she had resolved the issue. They knew full well that nothing had changed. I still receive the same error message and I cannot print. I have owned this computer for less than one year and it is totally unusable. Customer service is awful!"
295,1,"Never, never, buy HP","It has just stopped working, thankfully, after 13 months. We paid a goodly sum for this printer, and paid more for their ink subscription. But...you never really own this computer. To print ANYTHING, you MUST be online...no internet access...no printing!You can't use third party ink...It refuses to print until 'official' HP ink is installed.This morning, it had a complete meltdown and will not connect to the internet...so I can't print. And the HP Help page is worthless.I just ordered a Canon and this HP will be trashed.And.....I will NEVER buy anything from Hewlett Packard again."
296,1,Connectivity and setup issues.. do not buy,"This is my second hp printer in 2 years. Stopped working after 8 months of use. The printer wouldn't allow me to set up and connect it to my wifi. I kept getting charged for the ink subscription every month with the printer not working.  I spent literal hours on the laptop with hp support, which resulted in exactly no actual help. Definitely not buying from hp again. I have already wasted a lot of money on the printer and ink subscription. Please save your money and do not buy their printers."
297,1,Bait and Switch! Stay away!,"I hope the executives that came up with the protocol of forcing you to join an ink service or the printer won't work, all get sent to Guantanamo Bay. Horrible company! This printer used to work great. Now nothing works. If you follow the instructions on the computer, it leads to no solution. I can't get it to print, copy, scan or anything. The app doesn't work. Looks like if you don't join a service, the printer won't work. The only company as bad as HP would be AT&T."
298,1,Pain in the you know what!,"It was pain to set up the wireless connection. Thank god I have geek squad remote in to do it. It worked sometimes and seem difficult to actually get to print then after maybe 3 months of use and printing 20 pages it tells me ""set up incomplete"". So as we speak geek squad is setting up again. Very disappointed in this and wish I could return it. Im going to buy the cable and connect it pray that works better but the wireless connection/set up sux!"
299,1,WOULD NOT SET UP. Printer returned.,"I follow the directions, my computer would not recognize the printer.My wife called customer service, her computer would not recognize the printer.My wife finally got the PIN to show up has required, so I tried to print; my printer could not find my 8015e, but it accepted the 8010.However, after installing the 8010 hardware, the printer reads as offline even though it's on.Obviously it's being returned.In summation, caveat emptor, this product is entirely problematic."
300,2,Pain in the rear,"I have always bought HP on computers and printers.  Never had a problem.  Times have changed and now, on the printer, my personal opinion, worthless.Reasons:  Did not know, not told and not in the paperwork with the free ink you can use only 100 pages a month.  Making a quilt and using coloring books I went through a lot of paper, resizing and messing up as, for me, problems in learning how to work it, not like old one.So, I used over 200 pages in that month and next month probably the same.  We were charged $60 for going over the alloted number 100 a month.  Paid it and set to stop getting more ink.  They said they were shutting down the ability to use the ink, but, not using my messed-up brain (chemo brain from cancer) thinking it was shut down and I could use the rest of the ink, printed out more and we were charged $100.REALLY ticked off.  We bought another brand and it has less ink so ran out fast.  We get a notice that now you can only use HP ink and no longer use the off brands, they will no longer work on HP printers.  I am positive that is what was said, if wrong, someone correct me.THAT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW.  We now have to buy HP ink, which is more expensive.NOT HAPPY.  Would NOT recommend this brand of printer at ALL for anyone else.As sone as this one breaks down, I will be buying another brand.Old computer died so had to buy another one.  Son insisted I get a laptop (he knows a lot about computers, is border line genius (IQ 140) so picked up a Dell for me.  Works great, easy for me to use and when I need help, which is not often, he has no problem fixing it."
301,2,Not a fan of this printer,"I thought this printer looked equivalent to my last however I was wrong.  The print quality is low. The prints appear slightly faded in color and slightly blurry. And if that wasn't enough on its own, I can not enter more than 1 print job into the que at a time without it sending an error code and stopping halfway through.  And if the  single print job that I send is more than 6 or 7 pages, chances are it will error out and I will have to see how far it got, then re enter the request to print the remaining pages that didn't print the first time around. This is very frustrating to me.  If my husband hasn't burned the manufacturers box it came in already I would have requested a return.  Do not waste your money if you do a fair amount of printing or need a good quality print. Find one that does better"
302,2,SUPER FUN PUZZLE BOX!!!,"You're going to have to download the app, which...whatever, take my metadata. Eventually everyone will have it and no one will pay for it anymore. That mini-rant out of the way here's the review.User interface on the product side isn't great. Remember texting on a flip phone? Now, imagine putting in a secure wifi password on that bad boy every time you print.I don't print often, this stays at the house, so whatever required links it has to HP probably get severed between prints. Maybe that's the reason for the difficulty. I can say that when it prints it's of reasonably good quality, but it doesn't meet my specific needs, which is a printer that prints very rarely, but is on standby and ready to go when called upon. I have to register it with HP every time which is a 20 minute journey through their website, not the app. Take a second there and reread that sentence, I'll wait. Okay, you get that? I downloaded their app for them, for those poor shareholders there at HP, and they have the gall, the temerity to force me to go to their website to reregister the printer?I'm clearly looking for a printer in a different market segment that this printer at this price point doesn't support, and maybe the market won't bear (not sure).If you're like me and you're looking for this thing to just print right out of the box or wait patiently for you to send a print request this isn't that. Not sure what you're looking for, but it's not this.You know, it prints, after 20 minutes of work, and a lot of times it's a different issue so it's fun in that way. This little thing really keeps me on my toes. When it does actually print, it's nice, but I think that's the absolute bare minimum of a printer. 2 stars, does what a printer is supposed to do with a lot of effort. 5 star puzzle box though"
303,2,Amazon won't honor price protection as I have been a 10+ years of being a loyal prime customer,"My issue was never addressed or even offered any extra services for this printer that has dropped on price over 60 dollars total after just 2 days purchase on Amazon who also dropped price when I contacted customer service who said they don't offer price protection and who have to contact hp.  After having 1st order a factory defect and this having a bad black ink cartridge.  I told both hp and Amazon that since I would have to buy same product and purchase same product.  That after poor quality printers and having to return same product to get the new lower price has become so much of a hassle that I told hp if I have to return product 2 times in less than 3 weeks that I would keep product if hp would offer any incentive like 1 extra warranty to the 2 years that's included with this model or extend my ink trial, but was told only we cannot do anything because it already has 2 year warranty and couldn't even extend ink trial, so I will be returning thus product and go with Epson tank printer with 3 years of warranty and 3 years of ink supply.  I barely average printing 12 or less pages of printing.  So much for being a over 15 years of loyalty.  I will also update my followers on my many review sites with pics and screenshots of how hp support has become basically useless and values money over loyalty and they logo is HP ""we cant"" as they new slogan.  You can escalate this to the highest member of your support team, but I have emailed exes who haven't replied or said that it was out of their hand since I purchased it on Amazon, but it's same as going to target or bestbuys that offer price matching up to 14 days, 30 with my red card membership.  Seriously 2 days later it dropped 50 dollar before taxed and neither company has help resolve this issue.  Will not be buying hp products anymore after these issues for past month.  Printer seems fine now, that's only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 star."
304,2,HP OfficeJet 8015e or 8010,"Bought this one from Amazon because not only was it a great price but it also has features that I liked. Setup was quick and easy doing it myself on my 5 year old Ipad, connection to Wi-Fi was easy and it prints very nicely. Also printed using 8.5 X 14” sheets. Getting the door open to install the ink cartridges was a bit tricky, there is a very small button to push down on the left side to release it. Pros:. very big intray of 225 sheets. Auto copy up to 35 pages with two sided printing. Also Faxed from it with no issues. Got 6 months free ink which is very nice. Ink replacements already showed up so I will have no downtime. Have had 1 other hp printer for 2 years and the Ink comes before I need it.Signed up for the instant ink program since I already have another hp printer thats enrolled in that program. I like having the Ink come before I need it, it’s very convenient. I didn’t have to go looking for the Ink.  I am a dedicated HP printer user and have been for 30 years. Love this printer and I highly recommend this printer. Thanks to HP and Amazon, Have a nice Amazon and HP day.P.s. had a problem with both my printers loosing connection. HP tech support got me through it quickly, and the problem was not with the printers it was with our Wi-Fi router.P.s. I talked to hp tech support because two sided printing was not working. After trying to put the docs in the adf and copying, it would only copy and print one sided. The guy had me put a sheet in the scanner, copy it, then open the scanner flip page over and then it printed on the other side. But putting docs in the adf it would not print on both sides. He said that is how your printer functions. So Auto 2 sided printing does not really work on this printer. Took three stars off for that. It’s totally misleading."
305,2,Works but...,"The printer works, and that's the best thing i can say. Main pain point is the double sided scanning, which you do have to manually flip over each page just to scan both sides. Which sucks if you're scanning multiple pages.Next biggest pain point is that the cartridges dry out in like a month and a 1/2. It's so quick and not worth the cost."
306,2,Paper tray leg,"If you get a paper tray jam and break off one of the legs it won't work. Replacement tray is 70+ bucks. Ridiculous. They even make a part to fix the broken leg that costs 15 bucks, it's an obvious failure point in the machine."
307,2,I returned it,"The performance of this printer is extremely slow. It’s worth spending a bit more for a better model. I’ve been using HP printers for over 20 years and have owned more than 10, but this is by far the worst one I’ve ever had."
308,2,Does not print wireless on 5G,"I spent hours on the phone with customer service trying to get this printer to print wirelessly.  In the end, she told me that it would not work with 5G band from my internet provider so I would need to get a new router.  Printing has also come out very sporatically at times.  Printing hours after I sent to printer."
309,2,You get what you pay for with printers,"The ""3 months"" of ink included actually turned out to be 19 pages.  After 19 pages, the replacement toner cartridges were more than the cost of the printer.  The wireless connectivity really made the printing and scanning slow.  The copy functionality worked fine.  The HP 8620 is a far better product and worth the price bump."
310,2,Beware of customer support,Bought this to replace an old work-horse HP printer that served me well until the electronic failed.  First I want to note that it works well but features are not any different than much older unit it replaced.  Problem started when I hooked it up and attempted to download operating software online (no installation disc provided - common on newer stuff).Went to website - found software - download failed.  Contacted HP chat and they had 3rd party tech contact me by phone.  Downloaded team viewer and tech took over to complete installation.  Said installation failed due to viruses on my computer (I was running PC Matic but that was not good enough) so next he wanted 1800.00 for norton and 3 years tech support on 3 computers?  Finally went down to 350.00 for 1 year and without buying it - he would not install.  I was desperate because I wanted to print out my companies statements so I caved in - Yes I was and still feel I was ripped.  Norton caused my computer - not that old - to run like a slug - I went back to PC Matic and it works properly now.
311,2,IT'S OK,NOT super crazy about this printer.  Hard to replace the paper tray and the ink cartridges are TOO expensive.  Would NOT recommend this and I've had numerous HP Printers.  This is my LEAST favorite.
312,2,Annoying problems,"It does print… but while it’s printing it sends messages to your phone saying continue or cancel, if you hit continue then it will print again. Very annoying. Don’t buy this stupid thing."
313,2,Ridiculous ink usage,"I bought this printer in April and have printed out a total of 4 color pages. Everything else, less than 50 pages,  is in grey scale. I am already out of yellow ink. I printed one 8x10 color picture and three spreadsheets. That was September. Of course it only takes branded ink cartridges so I cannot replace it without paying the full price. I opted out of the recurring refill option because I rarely print. Now it is October and it stopped connecting to the wireless. After trying everything to troubleshoot I reached out to customer support only to find out that I need a USB 2.0 cable, which of course did not come with the machine so now I need to spent even more money and wait for delivery. So frustrating."
314,2,Needs to have a better sliding tray!,Paper drawer gets stuck when I'm trying to pull it out to add Paper it doesn't slide out out smoothly and sometimes it doesn't open up all the way !
315,2,Not user friendly,"This is my 3rd or 4th HP printer.  Up until this one, never had a problemSet up was a bi#@h. Finally had to use wire instead of wireless, still took hours ti get it working. Everytime the computer is off,  I have to go through the same setvup."
316,2,Too Much Ink,"After 3 months of sporadic use I'm already getting warnings that the magenta and cyan cartridges are running low. HP suggests you can print 315 pages with their standard color cartridges but I've only printed 58 color pages so far. The same is true for black and white where I've only printed 34. The estimated cartridge levels show under 25% already for all of them. And, of course, if I want to buy replacement cartridges from HP, it costs nearly as much as the printer did. I know that's how they make money but I certainly expected to get more out the ink cartridges than only ~33% of what they advertise."
317,2,No 2 sided print from a 2 sided document,I specifically purchased this printer thinking that it would copy from two-sided documents!  What a big fail. It only will make your single documents into one page front and back. I specifically wanted a printer so that I didn't have to squirrel around trying to figure out how to load the second part of a page on a two-sided document. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed that this said dual printing.
318,2,Connectivity,"Very difficult to set up, unable to add it to my WIFI so I needed to go buy a cord for it."
319,2,THE INK,The information was misleading regarding the ink for the printer. It only printed 30 pages total before running out.
320,2,Paper feeder doesn't work,"I have never had an issue with HP printer however this one, the paper feeder does not work."
321,2,I wouldn’t if I was you,"It’s extremely slow, the Wi-Fi print does not work that great at all. Way more pain and pleasure."
322,2,Required monthly fee to use it,This product requires a monthly fee to use it and this is not properly addressed in the description.
323,2,Broke after first paper jam,"Printer worked fine.Then, after the first paper jam, it stopped working.Spent lots of time on phone technical support.It cost me more money trying to fix it, after the first paper jam, than a new printer cost.HP, please make a higher quality printer that is more durable."
324,2,Junk,"Resets to factory startup every month or so, requiring setup, printing alignment page (expensive HP ink), reconnection to all machines, etc.  Huge waste of ink and time.  Moving on to a better brand."
325,2,Price has exceeded quality!,"Bought cheapest cost HP all in one printer to replace the same which is 10 yrs old. Not Windows 11 compatible. The new printer was so cheaply constructed, I was sure it would break under normal use. To get the same quality as the 10 yr old printer, I bought a printer that was more than twice the price!  Just so you know this was the case with most of the printers I looked at by a number of different makers.  Prices are ridiculous and quality is out the window.  If you rely on a printer you need to spend the extra money if you want it to last and be problem free!"
326,2,insufficient ink cartridges,"This printer doesn't print any better or worse or faster or slower than any other printer out there.The rather pricey color in cartridges are terrible. I didn't even get 100 pages out of them.I signed up for the instant ink program which sounded like it would save me some money on inks. Sounds good until you find out HP's idea of ""INSTANT"" ink is actually 10 days. I've had this printer for 3 weeks and have been unable to print for 2-1/2 of those weeks because I've been waiting on their ""INSTANT"" ink.I would NOT recommend this printer or HP in general."
327,2,How much do I hate this printer? Let me count the ways!,"This is an office jet printer, so it should be able to do two sided to two sided prints. Oh, but it doesn’t! You can turn on two sided printing and all that does is when it prints it will turn the paper over for you which doesn’t help because you have to turn it back over to put it back in the paper feeder to do the other side, two sided prints have to be done manually. Even if you use the upper feed. Paper tray is really cheap and a little top piece that fits on. It is a bear to get back on there and you have to do that every time you replace paper. I got this printer because my old HP printer just quit working. Then they sent me the ink for it anyway even after I told him I was trading it in so now I’ve got an extra ink cartridge and no printer to go with it. HP used to be local here in Idaho now I think they’ve shipped things to “you know where.”"
328,2,Only works well if you have good wifi,"Dislike that you cannot use a connection between the computer and printer. If your wifi is weak, you cannot get the printer to work. It also continually changes codes so you must update the printer/computer everytime you use it.  I would avoid.  The later versions of this printer were better. I regret purchasing this for my son for college.  It was a waste."
329,2,Snail pace slow,I bought this printer fir our church office. We have a small congregation and we use this printer seldom.  One of the reasons is it takes FOREVER to warm up and process to be able to print. Then it prints out the copies very slowly... this definitely does not suit our needs and really was a waste of the church's money. I wish I could return it or exchange it for a different model. Hewlett Packard is usually a good buy with good results. No this time at all
330,2,PAINFULLY SLOW,This is an average printer but EXTREMELY slow printing. I cant even deal with how slow this is and will be ordering another printer
331,2,Such a pain to try to set this printer up,"You have to download the app then you have to connect it to the printer and then the course it doesn’t connect. Such a waste of time. I bought many printers in the past and usually it’s a very simple process. If I do all over again, I would not have bought this printer. Just go with the simple ones. It’s easy to set up so you can start printing. Not worth wasting your whole day."
332,2,Mac Users Beware,"The scan button on the screen does not function with Mac OS. Unlike my prior HP (8610) which allowed me to select scan on the touch screen to scan and save document to a local drive, this model (8015) requires you to open the HP application on your Mac in order to scan and save. Huge step backward. Beware if you are using a Mac."
333,2,Resets often.,
334,2,Said it comes with 6 months INk has not received any ink,I never received free 6 months of ink
335,2,Loses Wi-Fi daily,I have to restart my printer multiple times per day because it loses Wi-Fi. It also stops working unless you use the high dollar HP cartridges. Overall not a great purchase for me.
336,2,Duped!!,"I have been using HP for many years.  This is the worst printer I have ever owned.  I don't use it much but when I need it.... I need it.  Constantly losing wifi connection, poor print quality, and have had to load drivers 2x's.  It was on sale for $99 and the HP replacement print cartridges for $94.  I tried to load non-HP ink cartridges but it would not work at all.....I could buy a new one instead of ink.  I am considering throwing it away and buying a different brand...  I did not catch this earlier because I don't use it that much........."
337,2,I've had better HP printers.,This may be my 5th HP printer and well they changed the Sofware and I cannot connect it to my HP computer. Go figure.Died in less than a year what a piece of crap.
338,2,Bad Purchase,"I had this printer 2 weeks and it prints right first page, then second page leaves blue streaks.  Having hard time staying connected to wifi."
339,2,This came with a huge scratch.,
340,2,Not a reliable printer,"So, my Epsom was old and I couldn't get it supported on my new computer.  I had promised myself that I would buy an HP my next printer because I felt an HP would be a longer lasting, more reliable printer.  How much farther from the truth could I get?  I am an occasional user, I don't use my printer/scanner every day or even every week.  Each time I try to use the printer I have to reconnect it to the modem.  The lights are all on and everything should be working, but no, unplug, reboot, reconnect, etc.  All I wanted was a reliable printer with no hassles.  This is not what I got.  I would like to return it, unfortunately it's been too long.  I will probably never buy an HP again.  Too much hassle and frustration."
341,2,A printer which is only good for a short time.,"What I find most difficult about HP printers is that they are good only for a short time.The printer works fine for a while then the computer (also an  HP) makes a change with the computer's software or hardware. I can't influence this change. After that change the printer never works again and HP's service doesn't help. One is only left, after spending a fruitless repair day, with the buying a new HP OfficeJet 8015e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer. This is the third HP printer I have been forced to buy."
342,2,HP OFFICE JET,"Purchased 3/31/2023 today is 9/14/2023. I have been an HP printer and supporter for over 10 years  This is slowly changing. The print, copy, and scan quality of this printer is outstanding, which is what I have learned to expect and admire from HP printers.With the last 3 printers I have purchased, there is no question regarding print quality, it is the build integrity.I have had this printer for just over 5 months and now  I am having a paper jamming issue. I have performed all the troubleshooting guides with zero results.  There seems to be an issue with the paper pick-up that I can not find, and then it jams and goes into an endless check printer cycle.I use a printer daily for reports and correspondence and now without a printer and unable to complete my work.Based on this I can not recommend a buy for this product."
343,2,Jams,This print jams every other time we use it. Would not recommend
344,2,Broke after a year with minimal use,"System threw an error that could not be cleared after 13 months of light use.  Holding the power button did nothing.  After unplugging the power and plugging it back in, the printer would not turn on.  For a cheap printer, it worked as advertised.  Just wish is lasted longer."
345,2,Very disappointed,"This printer has been nothing but problems.  Unfortunately I wasn’t using it much so didn’t realize how bad it was until after the return date.  It turns off the direct print feature so I have to keep turning it back on, and I have to repeatedly unplug the printer and plug it back in as it won’t show up on my iPhone print screen.  I didn’t want to spend a lot but I did expect the printer to perform correctly."
346,2,Horrible Connection Abilities,Simple features take hours to set up each day when I try to print or scan documents.  I have restarted the laptop and printer multiple times.  Downloaded HP Smart and went through the HP Easy Start download and installation for direct scanning.  The printer DOES NOT recognize my laptop when attempting to scan from the hardware and the HP Smart app either takes forever to (literal hours per day) to be able to print a PDF doc type ONLY or cannot access the printer's print or scan functions whatsoever.  I bought a cheap printer to perform simple functions and it causes me mostly frustration.  Look elsewhere for a simple printer.
347,2,Lasted 1 year,"Died 2 months after the warranty ran out. Regular use, no issues. Then error message of carriage jam, nothing actually jammed.. beyond repair. Worked great for a year."
348,2,"WiFi disconnects, wont stay connected. HP support scam-like. Decent hardware but major flaws","WiFi randomly becomes disconnected, I have reset it no less than 10 times in the last week.  Once you get WiFi back, it requires you a complete reset up and this can take a lot of time. Messaged HP support from thier website and PCMACWIN called me and began a process of talking me through, asked to access my computer, DONT DO THIS. He wanted $199 to fix my issue and my printer isn't even a year old yet.  Today it's back to offline, wifi disconnected, I reconnected it and now wants me to do set up all over again with the app and on computer.  Frustrated and think something must be wrong in its software or maybe its hardware.  Is this a one year warranty?  Anyone experiencing this issue too?"
349,2,Printer loses connection to internet frequently.,"Whenever internet connection is loss, requires you to go through complete setup again. It gets stuck in a loop that says ""setup incomplete..."" This printer is trash. I'm looking for a printer that will remember the setting when the power or internet is loss like most modern electronics today.I will say the print quality is good when it works. Just need a lot of software improvement."
350,3,Just ok,"It’s been a year since purchased this WiFi printer, copier, scanner, e-fax; felt time to give a thorough review so consumers can make an informed decision on whether or not this would be good option. Bought black Friday sale…reasonably priced.Didn’t realize when purchasing; e-series means subscription service for ink &/or paper. It actually turned out to be a better deal; especially the paper is way cheaper than purchasing individual reams. The recycling feature of ink cartridges is seamless. They keep track of everything; send cartridges when ink is low & paper before run out. All processed thru HP app; pick a monthly plan based on average usage…w/ rollover for any unused portions & up charge for overages. Simply box up used cartridges & return in recycling box included; put in mailbox. As a physically disabled person, this is quite beneficial.There are some functionality issues:1 – the paper tray has a design flaw. It isn’t easy to set it for 8-1/2 x 11 paper. The lever doesn’t move easily that’s located inside at front of tray to secure  paper so it doesn’t pull crooked & cause a jam. Yet, there is a workaround. In center right of inside tray bottom is a small rectangular button, pushing that down will allow paper tray to slide in for 8-1/2 x 11 to be more secure. However, even that has a design flaw as it doesn’t lock tray. Any little movement while putting tray back into printer can be frustrating as it often slides back to 8-1/2 x 14 position. Repeat until position is correct; more frustration. Tray lid is a little wonky as well.2 – paper jams paper jams paper jams after paper jams! Also, nearly every sheet of paper that comes out, upper left-hand corner is folded forward nearly an inch. Using  recommended paper doesn’t seem to make a difference. Also, larger the print job, higher likelihood for paper jams. Not too hard to clear out jams though. There is a blue lever in the back that can be released, even removed to clear out any residual paper jammed in rollers or tray.3 - error message regarding “ink subscription requires activation”; wouldn’t allow use of printer at all. HP automatically took WiFi connection off-line rendering it unusable; even though ink cartridges were 3/4 full. Thought subscription expired; had been abt a year since subscription activation. Checked app…showed still had 25 days left before renewal. Not sure what happened…renewed anyway & updated payment type. Thought maybe card on file expired or something of that nature; but that didn’t fix it. Went thru all troubleshooting guidance provided on app. Still not fixed. Don’t bother using the bot chat tech-support. Call HP directly if have any issues.Spent 2-1/2 hours on phone w/ tech-support trying to troubleshoot issue. 2 different techs & both had difficulty finding solutions; even repeating some of same things already tried. One tech kept saying to push the “back button“ repeatedly in rapid successions to try & clear out error message. But had to “hold down” when pressing the back button. Tech was probably a little frustrated w/me; I figured it out, he didn’t. But it still didn’t fix issue, although it did go back to Home Screen. Error message came back up after cycling thru calibration & updating software. Wound up going thru process to factory settings & finally cleared error message; printing then commenced. However, immediately got a paper jam & corner was still folding on what sheets did make it out. Addressed this w/ tech-support.They send a text w/ link so can remote access camera to see the display screen on printer…that was helpful. Also, allowed tech to look inside printer, guide on which parts to remove, assist inspect for defects or other obstacles that may have been impeding performance. No visible signs of defect or damage. Now just waiting on different paper type from HP to see if different quality of paper may not fix paper issues. They’re keeping claim # work order open tho until get new paper from HP for trial run. If issue persists w/ jams & folded corners, & it’s still under warranty…it’ll be replaced w/ different series printer. Was told newer series have similar trays; but did say they’re an improvement from the 8000 series. Mine is the 8010 e series.I’m fairly tech savvy; this wasn’t an easy issue to fix…even w/ tech-support. Then there’s also the outstanding issue of the paper & tray.  If it hadn’t been for troubleshooting support, would’ve just bought a new printer.If you’re on a budget & looking for a reasonably priced wi-Fi printer copier scanner e-fax w/ subscription features; supports multiple OS platforms too, I would suggest this printer for smaller print jobs only. This isn’t a large volume output printer.It’s great it can print or fax right from your phone! For the black Friday price paid & subscription features, I’ll hold onto this one for now. Eventually, will replace w/ something more durable; capability of printing multiple pages w/o jamming. Since don’t print regularly, it will suffice for now. Would have loved giving it 4 stars bcz it does a good job w/ print quality of ink w/o smearing or coming out wet. Not bad for an inkjet printer. I may have just gotten a bad egg. If cost is a concern… Still isn’t a bad printer that’s reasonably priced."
351,3,Get a USB cord to save you frustration,"I was very excited to receive the 8010e series scanner and printer. I got it out of the box, tape and plastic removed, set up on stand, plugged in, downloaded the HP Smart from 123.hp.com. I was setting up for a Wi-Fi printer, but when it came to the driver/program working with the internet, I discovered a glitch. Each time I entered in my Wi-Fi password OR set it to automatically detect it, in the next click for installing, the moment I clicked I noticed my Wi-Fi cut out and it eventually give me an error message that the program ""can't connect to my Wi-Fi network.""I did a troubleshooting search that suggested disconnecting my VPN, so I did. And I started all over, yet each time, the HP Smart program for the printer interrupted my Wi-Fi, thus the printer could not communicate with my computer and HP, I assume.I searched comments about this issue and found that 90% of them mentioned this issue. I can tell you, it'll be VERY frustrating. My suggestion is to BYBASS the FRUSTRATION and just order the printer cable to use with your printer or laptop.I'm not using it for my mobile device, hopefully cell phone users won't experience this BIG GLITCH.Hey, HP Programmers, YOU NEED TO FIX THIS. It's a SERIES issue considering the main marketing focus for your product HP 8010e Series is THE WIFI PRINTING.Now, I bought this for scanning. I'm not impressed. The highest resolution it scans at is 300dpi. I am an artist. I haven't had a scanner in over a decade, but back then, there were options for scanning at MUCH higher resolution for artwork. Not sure if that's changed, as did the phonograph when they removed the 78 speed. But it's really a let down.I haven't printed anything yet. I'm waiting for my photo paper. Once I do, I'll write a review about print quality."
352,3,Nothing good to say - update.,"Update: It took persistence to actually get a live customer service human being. She did fix the issue. Still a 3 just bc of the 2 hour hassle, but the printer is great. I was told that I did not have to be in their ink delivery program. She cancelled it for me. I did it before, and I think that is why it wasn’t working.First review: I have had since September. I have always been an HP fan until now. I wish I could return it!! Definitely not worth the time I have wasted on it. I have just spent an hour trying to print a return label. They insist on their ink, and so I went along with it. Every time I try to print, they say I am not setup, but I am and have even received ink from them that I do not want. If you are fine using a cable to print, then great. However, if you want to print wifi, then forget it. I am ready to boycott HP forever!!! They owe me for the time I have wasted on this piece of brand bullying trash!!"
353,3,It didn't work for long,"This is not the greatest printer I have ever had, but it was inexpensive, and after difficulties setting it up (which required a call for technical help from HP), it works. The printer connects to the internet and only in that way can one tell how much ink one has left and whether more is required. There's a choice of ink and paper subscriptions, which of course add on fees, but the first three months are free.It got to the point where I simply had to have a printer, and this was the best I could get for the lowest amount. As noted, not the greatest, but it does work.(Nov. 3, 2024: I'm adding an addendum here. The printer basically worked for about 6 weeks and then I didn't need it for a while. I printed a few pages now and then but 6 weeks ago it stopped printing clearly. I had to order new ink, which was NOT automatically shipped when the ink was low, wait until it arrived, and then discovered that the printer still didn't work. Black and white pages were unclear with much of the type not showing.HP agreed today to replace the defective unit and extend the warranty, but the project of getting them to respond to the defect was so time consuming, during weeks of which I was unable to print, I'm pretty unhappy overall.I would definitely NOT order this unit again nor would I recommend it. For the amount of printing I got out of this unit, it was VERY costly indeed, in terms of both time and money, not to mention aggravation.)"
354,3,I'll let you know after a year.,"This is the 3rd one I have bought (8010, 8020, and this one is the 8015e). The feed mechanism for document scanning/copying function broke on the first one (8010) after about a year.  The 8020 worked great for a couple years before my cat puked on it and fried the paper jam sensor, which made it think there was a paper jam,  when there wasn't, which completely disabled the printer.I was happy with the 8020 until the cat killed it, but there was one issue I hated about both of the first two models, which was their need to perform 'printer maintenance' sometimes, when you wanted to use them. It could take a few minutes before it finished doing that, which was annoying. I couldn't understand why it wouldn't automatically do that when it was idle, since it has the capability of turning itself on and off.  Why did it have to do it when you wanted to print something?I just bought this model (8015e) because, for the price, these printers are great for home AND office use, AND because I already had 2 brand new sets of ink cartridges stocked up that weren't cheap and I didn't want to just toss them. Yes, they were costly, but no more and much less than some of the others that go with other printer brands.So far, what I have noticed is that with this model, the maintenance cycle is much quicker and probably takes no more time than printing an extra document. Not sure about much else yet, but I'll update this in a year.I'd also like to mention the other great feature of these HP printers (the previous two, probably this one too, not sure yet), which is that you don't have to refill the color ink to print in black (or grayscale mode). Unlike so many other brands' printers, which won't let you print if your color cartridges are empty."
355,3,Like everything else these days it's an overly complicated electronic,I wanted a printer that would direct print from my mobile phone without needing an internet connection.  Did my research and this was one of the printers that does direct wi fi. Don't tell you you can't just plug it in and use it. Have to have an internet connection.  Finally get it set up after two days and an hour on the phone with tech support and now discover it will not print any word documents through direct print. Have to get it online. Frustrating and infuriating. Does not deliver on the only reason I chose that  model printer.  Disappointed.
356,3,Continuing paper jams,"Interfacing with Apple this product has me jump thru another hoop before printing. I know it’s just me. I have yet to call customer support, but plan on after this weekend on sale, the price is right. One more thing, there’s only enough ink in the cartridges that come with it to last about half a week. I called and asked, that’s what I was told, therefore I purchased their “ program of ink supplies."
357,3,So fed up with this printer,"3 stars is so considerate. Really more like a 1-2 star item. This printer worked well for like 3 months after it took me an hour to get it hooked up and programmed. I am a 29 y/o male and mostly quick with electronics. The printer was hooked up to my laptop and also an app on my phone and was very cool for a little while. I thought it was cool to be able to print from my phone. I also liked that i could print on envelopes.However, the ink runs out super quick. Its extremely expensive to replace. The printer is very slow. AND i have lost the hookup status i had to my wifi and it is being a nightmare to get working again. I have fiddled with it for about 20 minutes on 3 separate occasions and im so over it. I would rather throw it out the window and start over with a toner printer. I have a toner printer that i have replaced the toner on 3 years ago and it is still running strong!!"
358,3,A love hate relationship,"I have a love hate relationship with this printer. I love that it was extremely easy to set up. I plugged it in, and because I already have another HP inkjet printer in the house, this one literally set itself up, connecting to my wifi, and being a simple press of a button to ""add"" this new printer on my computer. Done.I have read through a number of the other reviews of this printer that have been posted here. Some of the criticisms don't make sense to me, such as the complaint that you have to press two buttons to load the paper. That is not true. The paper try simply slides out for reload with no button pressing needed.The print quality of this printer is essentially the same as virtually all HP inkjets I have used over the past decade or longer. If you want stunning results for photos you have to use special photo paper. Printing on plain paper limits the quality of the output--plenty good enough for getting the work done though.My big complaint with this printer, and most inkjets from HP, is the insufferable grinding and rolling and clicking and whatnot the stupid thing does for minutes on end before printing. And THEN having to endure all of it again and again every time a new ink cartridge is inserted and for the periodic maintenance cycles it goes through, etc. My gosh! It is ridiculous! And secondly, the ""HP Smart"" software is SO SLOW! The app is excruciatingly slow already, but then it feels the need to launch my browser and take me to the HP website for all kinds of things that ought to be available at the printer itself, and I cannot believe that the website for a huge company like HP can be so slow and clumsy. It literally takes about 5 minutes for the website to finally get to my account and my printer status and my ink level readings and so on. Unbelievable! Seriously, HP, hire someone who can write some reasonable efficient code for your website. I am docking the product 2 stars for the terrible software performance and the incessant and slow ""grinding"" the printer feels the need to do all the time."
359,3,FEATURES ARE 5 STAR...HOWEVER....,"Yes, the print quality is outstanding as was the touch screen and Tech Support, the latter being the reason for an overall 3 star rating.  I tried for nearly two hours to set up the printer (touted for it's easy set up) on a brand new Windows 11 HP computer but in the end had to reach out to support because it simply would not find my wireless network with the modem and router not 5 feet away.  Yes, the support was excellent but it required them to remote into my computer (something I'm always wary of) and a further 90 minutes to get it working.  Shouldn't be that hard.  Also know that while there is a document feeder that will copy multiple pages, it will not scan that way.  Scanning is one-page-at-a-time so if you have a three page document you want to scan, you have to scan individual pages and you'll end up with 3 docs on your computer:  Page 1, Page 2 & Page 3.  The product description doesn't really make that clear and if you assume that because it will doc feed a copy, it will also doc feed a scan (like I did)...it won't."
360,3,Good enough for the value.,"I don’t like the real small touch screen when navigating the display menu. The initial printer set up took me (one and half hours), most of that was dealing with installing the software and HP Smart app on my cell phone. Very frustrating. After all that this printer should do the job. Likely, my laptop has Windows software that will work to scan documents from this HP OfficeJet 8015e."
361,3,ARM64 Chip,"If your device has an ARM64 Processor, the HP Smart software will not install. They need PnP to run the software and windows 11 omitted it in this version. since all the ""all-in-one "" drivers are in HP Smart, all the printer will do is print. So 3 stars for the printer. When HP gets me some drivers for the other features I purchased, they can have the other 2.Hope this helps."
362,3,Find Something Else...,Although the print quality is an 7 out of 10... The ink runs out pretty fast. The advertising states 6 months of ink... Used printer 7 times and was out of ink. And no I didn't print a lot of items. Wireless connection works great. The ink running out very fast and the cost of ink for replacement is what SUCKS.
363,3,Stops working,Stops working less then a year after buying it
364,3,It's fine,"I purchased this printer to print name tags for my Chamber of Commerce once a month. Our tags have a teal design, so I was disappointed when the cyan toner ran low after printing only about 17 pages. I had to replace the toner just days after receiving the printer. Additionally, the software glitched when I needed to print something urgently, incorrectly showing the printer as ""offline."" While I eventually figured out how to bypass the error, I'm not happy with how quickly the cyan toner ran out. If the printer wasn't so bulky, I would have considered returning it."
365,3,"It's ok,  but I liked other HP printers better","This is the third HP printer I owned. While it prints ok (when it prints), I'm not a fan of the overall design. This one does not feel as solid as the previous two HP printers I've owned. The paper tray is clunky, so removing it is not a smooth operation like the others. The wifi connection is strong, but often times printing from iOS devices just goes into a black hole where the printer never wakes up to print. Printing through their HP Smart app, however, will make the print job go through. Sometimes the printer will whirr and grind for 1-2 minutes before it prints the sheet, so that's not always good when you just want to quickly get a copy of something. Overall I'm not happy with the performance or design of the printer. I'm keeping it because I paid for it and it will have to do for the time being."
366,3,Slowest printer on market!,This printer is extremely slow. It takes about 45 seconds to a minute to print one color page.
367,3,"It was broken and was not work, so I threw away",I threw away in two months because it wasn't work properly.And bought another one through Amazon.
368,3,Lacking In Performance,"I was excited to get it. It was moderately difficult to set up. Started printing, it can't do a large print order. It does best plugged into my computer and only one page at a time. I don't have a large use for it, so kept it for my small print jobs. Would not repurchase."
369,3,"Good printer ,but…","I’ve used H P printers for years. Normally good luck, but this printer has lost Wi-Fi connection 3 times in the last 3 months. I never had this problem before. It’s been very aggravating to reset the setting right when you’re trying to print a document. Hopefully not all HP printers are like this. Good Luck?"
370,3,Slow,memories insufficient on the printer it takes forever to print and process image and color
371,3,Jams consistently; beware ofvother issues,"Pretty rickety. Nice interface between phone, laptop and printer. Prints fast when it's not jammed, big hassle. Beware of their ink program, research it before you press the yes button, because if you do you're on for life.Also, color prints of photos are AWFUL!!!!Too much trouble return it, so keeping it."
372,3,Not so great,Bought this to replace an older HP office jet and rather disappointed with quality of this printer compared to the other one I had. This one is very flimsy. I don’t think it will last long. Also prints much slower than my other officejet. I usually love HP products but I’m disappointed with this printer. Doesn’t live up to HP standards.
373,3,"Lots of Functionality, Buggy Setup","Setup failed a couple of times, had to turn printer off and on a couple of times before it was found.  Installing cartridges was a mess too.  Once up and running it does a lot for not that much money.  The installation process pretty much forces you to enroll in a support plan, including the free ink offer, using either your phone or computer to do the install. Much larger footprint than the Brother it replaced.  I like that it takes four ink cartridges versus using a multicolor cartridge.  I just resent the big brother approach that HP uses."
374,3,No power cable,"Didn't come with a power cable, and now the paper feed tray won't close. Can't attest to the actual performance until I buy a power cable for it, it should definitely be more clear about the lack of components."
375,3,More trouble than it's worth,"This printer replaces a Canon I had used at home for years (maybe 15?) with nothing more than basic occasional issues. In contrast, during the four weeks I have owned this HP printer, I have had multiple recurring problems. The printer goes offline for no apparent reason; scanning is not available; my iPhone cannot find the printer, but my laptop can; printing (when it is working) takes a very long time to happen. Troubleshooting the printer is also frustrating since HP support resources always suggest first that there is an issue with my network (it's never the network) or with my laptop (it's never the laptop). On top of that, parts like the paper tray and the feeder guides feel cheap and are difficult to adjust. If it weren't such a hassle to pack this printer up, ship it back, and then find and buy another printer, I would have already sent it back."
376,3,Had all kinds of trouble getting started,I am pretty computer savvy but trying to get this to scan and or print envelopes was a nightmare.  But I can say that  my last resort was HP tech support.  He had to take over my computer and fix things.  Windows 11 suck.  I have not used this printer yet so its performance I cannot say.  Three stars is because of the problems trying to get it to work. After 6 hrs of trying It took Tech Support about 20 min.
377,3,Will I ever get to Print,
378,3,Paper tray is poorly designed and defective.,"I am a loyal HP printer customer and have loved my other HP printers. This one, though, is going to be returned.It was easy to set up, so there's that.I have had this printer two days and it has jammed or mis-printed, pulling more than one piece of paper through, printing partial pages, many times. This is frustrating and inefficient.I can only describe the paper tray as dinky. I am shocked that HP let this product go to market like this. It's hard to tell when the tray is in and the tray cover that latches to the top and catches the printed pages is very hard to latch. The design for this part of the printer is defective."
379,3,Very SLOW,"I have had HP products for a while now, and I wanted a printer that prints quickly and also scans through the feeder quickly! Well unfortunately this printer is the absolute opposite, I have a small at home business and need to scan papers on a daily. There is no way with this printer I`d get my job done in a timely manner."
380,3,An absolute bear to set up.,"I tried to set this up on my iPad and got a message that I had to do it on a laptop.  Then the laptop sent a message that I had to update HP Smart but provided no easy way to do so.  Suffice it to say, it took 4 hours but once all devices were in agreement, it was great.  However, it does not automatically recognize the size of the paper.  If you switch to 4x6 photo, the option to choose a different paper does not come up on HP Smart.  You have to be right in front of the device to choose the change in paper on the screen on the printer.  I do not know many people who sit right next to their printers all the time.  For this reason alone, I may get a different printer."
381,3,No Operating Instructions,"This machine arrived with setup instructions that were not thorough and caused us two frustrating hours and $50 for outside help.  Then we realized there are no operating instructions so we are guessing how to make copies.  The touch screen doesn't beep when a block is touched but it does respond.  This difficult machine replaces an HP Envy 5530 we had for 10 years and loved until it failed.  Sadly, this is not an improvement over that machine. The 6 months free ink is NOT AUTOMATIC...you must request it but this is not evident until you get a message from HP showing you have two months free ink.  The customer service person I spoke with eventually resolved this but while I was on hold a child got on the phone and talked about potatoes.  I'm expecting to have problems with this machine."
382,3,Okay nothing great,Just okay . I-replaced  my old ho printer with this. I found it slow and a little frustrating. When i hit copy i have to hit how many copies and it is annoying that it often causes it to give me a ink status. I dont love it  but its functional. Not HPs best or even vlose.
383,3,Poor quality product,This is a very poor product. It loses connection with the printer easily whether hardwired or WiFi. It pulls multiple sheets at once from the tray causing glitches in the printing thereby wasting ink and paper. It doesn’t scan half the time. And the build quality is cheap and poor plastic. Not worth the effort or price.
384,3,Basic printer,The print quality is not very good on this one. It takes longer than most printers to print also. Nothing special.
385,3,Should've research more,"This printer was vry easy to set up and connect wirelessly. But it is slow, makes slots of clunking sounds before and after printer, and the ink is a real nuisance and waste of plastic. Individual cartridges for each color come with large plastic caps that have to be removed and discarded. Luckily, I don't have to do a lot of printing."
386,3,Get this problem fixed,"I got the problem taken care of and will not be returning the printer. It was an easy fix, and the biggest problem is as i thought HP trying to get more money from the buyer. It's not a Amazona problem at all. Sorry for any problems i did."
387,3,It was great until dying,"I really liked this printer for the year or so I had it. Then, it just suddenly died. No power. Wasn't the cord. Tested it. And, there was nothing really to do except take it to recycling center and look for a new one. Given the price, I won't complain. The money is in the ink, not printer so they're not meant to last. Like a barbecue grill. Buy for a year or two and then replace."
388,3,Expected better performance.,"I suppose the printer is adequate for the price, but I have been a bit disappointed in the quality of the print job. The black is not as jet black as one would expect. Also, no matter how well-aligned you feed the document into the feeder rack, when you scan it, the scan comes out crooked. I have tried everything to fix that to no avail. quite frustrating actually."
389,3,one out of two ain't bad,"1st printer failed during setup. 2nd printer took three days longer to arrive. Fairly quick and easy setup. Unfortunately 2nd printer failed during power up sequence. Unplugged for few minutes and it seems ok since. Not feeling overly confident this printer will last long.After week of use pros are... good print and scan quality.cons... noisy and long ""printer maintenance"" messages as it does repeated print like noises while actually doing nothing.Previous printer cost three times as much and worked well for almost four years. Truly believe Hp purposely causes these mystery printer issues forcing us into another purchase and yet more E-landfill donations.I cant yet say if I would actually purchase this printer again. Probably not."
390,3,Worked great for a month,"It ran out of black ink, so we put in the new ink cartridge that came with the printer and it completely stopped printing in black. No amount of cleaning, head alignment, or chatting with the HP bot helped.  Worthless. It was so perfect! And then, inexplicably,  it wasn’t. I suspect it has something to do with the smart cartridge. I’ve ordered a non-smart ink cartridge to sidestep the whole overly-clever way of screw-ing buyers. We’ll see if that helps."
391,3,Confused,Setup was difficult and confusing compared to previous hp printers so I returned it.
392,3,Make Sure Read ALL Features.,"Excellent printer, but I also do a lot of scanning.  This unit doesn't do duplex scanning."
393,3,Good printer,Wouldn't let me sign up for the 6 months of ink the day j set it up now I can't get it.  Kind of a rip off.  It was a major perk to why i bought it
394,3,"Advertises ""6 Months Free Ink"" But Printer Not Eligible","The printer works well and prints quickly and of good quality so far. We've been using it for the past 3 months and all has been fine. Recently we started running low on a color cartridge when I remembered that it came with ""6 months free ink,"" so I go to register the printer to claim this...""The printer is not eligible"" on the the site to register for HP Easy Ink. Amazon support has no one to contact. I tried contacting the HP website support numbers and WhatsApp chat and the numbers ""are not in service"" or ""cannot be found."" Chileeeee :/ Happy with the print quality but disappointed in the false advertising for 6 months free ink when the printer isn't even eligible for it according to their website. Sigh."
395,3,Ink,Ran out of ink ordered ink online and the printer does not work. It does not recognize the new ink cartridges.
396,3,TOO COMPLICATED TO SET UP,"I believe this printer involves too many steps to set up. I'm not an engineer, but I've been using electronics for over 30 years. The wireless feature was a HUGE problem. And you may as well forget about talking to a human about support."
397,3,Part broke on loader,I dislike that it had a broke part and it didn't  give ink for six months as promised  in ad.
398,3,Hook up,Was very hard to hook up to our phones on wireless.  Go to YouTube to see how to hook up to a Chrome book.  I also ordered the free e ink and it expired before we got the printer up and running
399,3,Last a year tops,I purchased this Aug 2023 and it has stop receiving print job this only last me about a year! And the ink is 150.00 each time I have to replace it. I worked great brand new but with time it has issues.
400,4,The ink that came with the product didn't last long,"These new printers allow for ""cloud printing"" so you can access them without being in the same building for example.  HP now tries to sell you on a monthly subscription for ink.  Sounds good, and appears to be a good value, but if you sign up they can cancel your ability to print if you haven't renewed your subscription.  I didn't want to risk that and didn't like the control factor from HP, so didn't sign up.  The printer works fine.  Perhaps because the setup has the cloud features, it was a bit more complicated to get it running.  Also, to install the cartridges, you have to have the top cover closed, the front cover open and then you can open to reveal the cartridge area.  Found lots of people asking the question about not being able to do this, so the instructions could be better."
401,4,Multifunction home printer,"This is my second same printer. Just better quality than the cheap entry-level models. Easy to connect although you have to download the HP app and register. You get a lot of advertising from the HP store. Wireless and easy to access from your computers and phone. But you have to download HP smart everywhere. Of course, the HP toners are ridiculously expensive. They make a lot of money from that."
402,4,Still getting used to it,Easy to set up. Larger than I expected. Not sure how the “multi-print” cartridges will work.
403,4,No luck with HP Smart for scanning but driver software worked.  Document feeder finicky.,"I had no luck with HP Smart for scanning.  I had to additionally install the driver software to get scanning to work.  Overall a nice printer with good value for the money, especially if one buys Amazon Renewed.  When using the document feeder, make sure the paper is in the slot between the upper and lower lips.  There are some infrequent network glitches.  Sometimes the network connection is lost and one must use the Wireless Connection Wizard to choose the network and re-enter the password.  Sometimes when a Save is done for a scan the software hangs.  I like the 2.2 inch display.  Some of the HP All-In-One inkjet printers like the HP 8028e have a 2.7 inch color display.  A warning about the so-called ""Free ink"".  If one subscribes, the printer firmware is forever and irrevocably changed so that the printer can only use genuine HP ink.  I always use HP ink but did not do the HP ink subscription since I do not want to limit my options and want to order ink when I know I need it.  (I once destroyed the print heads by using bad third party ink).  Also, one cannot use the printer for scanning unless non-empty ink cartridges are loaded.  And if the HP ink subscription has been done, these must be HP ink cartridges.  And one needs an internet connection to initially set up the printer."
404,4,HP Printer,This printer is easy to set up. Best part  is for 6 months you get free ink and then for a small cost you can have them continue to have ink sent to you. This is my second HP printer.
405,4,"Good printer, HP ink only","Good printer, like the smaller size and print quality. Tried half price bargain brand ink after the 3 month free ink HP supplies, but the printer rejected all cartridges, returned for a refund. Purchased HP ink, all good so far. Don't be duped into believing cheap ink works, HP controls that."
406,4,It is easy to set up,It is very affordable
407,4,Printing text well,"If you care, it does print fast.  The text is clear and sharp.  Color?  Hit-and-miss, but all  printers  print color poorly.You have to go on line to set the printer.  The instructions are jammed with ads to buy their ink package.  Regardless, the instructions require that you have better than average computer skills.  ""swipe the dashboard.""  means  ?"
408,4,Great Value on an excellent printer!,Say to get hooked up and connected to my local network. It was easy to install the ink and get a printing from all of my mobile devices in the house. My only issue is that the thing doesn’t seem to last too long. I’m already replacing the black cartridge and haven’t had the printer but a month
409,4,Print quality as expected,"This is our third HP in 25 years. We’ve been very happy with them and with our ink “deal” we can print as many copies as wanted/needed.  We gave it a 4 because the paper tray is crap. It is hard to get in and out, binding on the sides and just frustrating to use. So, if you change paper often or use a lot of paper - given a choice, pick a different HP model."
410,4,Great printer for small office,i was expecting larger ink cartridges
411,4,"Connects easy, quality print, cheap plastic housing","This printer connected quickly to my wifi, so no issues there. The printing is great quality, which is the most important. Cons are the quality of the printer itself is very cheaply made. the plastic housing is very clumsy, hard to open/close the paper drawer, or open the scanner. The touch screen is clumsy as well, hard to scroll down to more options on the screen without selecting the wrong thing. One side of the footing of the printer is secure/rubber feet??, but the other side slides on my desk top so all opening/closing of the printer paper drawer, etc, causes the whole unit to slide around. I have to hold the printer still to open/close the drawer, and meanwhile fight with the drawer itself to open/close. Minor issues, as it prints well....and I know you get what you pay for. The other con in setting up is the multiple times you have to tell it you don't want to sign up for HP+ for auto ship of ink. Maybe it's cheaper?? But sorry, most times auto shipping of things charges your account sooner than necessary and I don't want that (e.g. Chewy's auto ship of anything - I'm always having to delay shipment as it's too soon). I don't trust that HP is going to ship at the point that I actually need the ink, plus it has a fee regardless from what I can tell. To get auto downloads of updates, and to register your printer, you have to sign up for HP+. It appears as though I can manually update the software when I'm ready without signing up. We shall see. Overall, I think the printer will be fine for my minimal usage."
412,4,Pros and Cons of This Printer,"I upgraded from my old HP All-In-One Ink Jet Printer. I like the color printing with this printer for personal photos.I'm disappointed with the slowness of the printing action , or the way the paper tray is set up.I haven't tried all the functions yet."
413,4,A bit Bulky but nice overall,"I like the simplicity, not the size. Also you can not scan more than 6 pages at a time"
414,4,"Fast, great for everyday printing!","Really awesome printer!  Prints very quickly and at a nice quality, both color and black and white.  The best use for this type of printer is as an office printer, or daily use printer for articles, recipes, etc.  Photos can be printed, but don't expect the best quality or to be able to print a large photo.Does not use up ink fast and allows it to last a long time.  When first purchasing, we received 6 months free ink which was a fabulous benefit and made the price of the printer that much better!!  Connects easily to the phone app and computer making printing stress-free and easy!The one issue I had was the ink drying out or clogging, which maybe was my fault for going so long without printing anything (~2 months).  I had to go through the cleaning and alignment process about 4x before the ink started functioning normally again, which was kind of annoying.I do still highly recommend though, as the price point is great if your not looking for a photo printer!!"
415,4,Great printer,"Connects with all our devices with ease.  Prints my cards beautifully.  The only drawback is the sliding tray to hold the prints.  Seems very flimsy.  Has worked so far, but doesn’t seem sturdy."
416,4,Feeder trey,Like the printer but paper tray cheap and fragile. Have to be careful because can be easily damaged.
417,4,Non functional in wireless mode,I could not connect this HP printer wirelessly to my HP (3 year old) wireless tower. The HP wireless tower which is currently wirelessly connected to the internet and apartment wifi. I consulted HP and a tech could not get it to work with instructions transmitted to me. Next the tech remoted into my computer and still could not wirelessly connect to my HP tower. The only way this printer works is to be hard connected to the tower with a USB B cable.Unfortunate.
418,4,Replacement Printer,"Had 2 prior HP Printers and no problem but this one is made cheaper. Paper tray is very flimsy plastic.  Do not like the 4 separate ink cartridges will see how long they last. Price & size of printer was what decided my purchase of this printer.  When printing envelopes the lettering was wavy & not clear which made for hard recognition of some letters and I even modified the paper size for the envelope size so that is not the reason for the poor print quality on envelopes.  My HP Smart App had an error message “We couldn’t retrieve your account data”.  I contacted HP Support & it took him over an hour because he had to do some updates to correct the error and whatever he did my envelopes are printing OK.  If you experience problems with printing envelopes I would recommend contacting HP customer service  I do want to say I had contact with 2 HP customer service reps. & both were very congenial to work with me.  I am in my 70’s & not tech savvy & my computer is older which of course took longer to load & he was very patient with me.  As I said I am not tech savvy but I was able to connect the printer so it is not hard to connect.  So far I have not had any problem printing from my iPhone or computer.  Hopefully, I won’t experience any problem losing WiFi.  Definitely liked my older printer but this one will serve my purpose. Still too early to give a good honest review because only had it a few days."
419,4,It worked and delivery was terrible,
420,4,Printer,Home use
421,4,8015e printer?,"I bought this to go with my Windows 10 HP laptop.  What shocked me was, when I hooked it up and started to-it was NOT plug 'n' play like the old printers.  You have to download their program for printing, you have to download for scanning, you have to download for faxing. UGH!!!!!!! HP is in every corner of my computer experience. No privacy!And her is the BIGGIE!  When I went to download: the screen shows my printer IS NOT HP 8015e, BUT 8010e. This is a SHELL GAME!WTF?  I have not had time to call HP, but I will next week.  So, buyer beware.Previously I had an EPSON for 15 yrs and G-5 all but stopped it from working properly. One glitch after another.  I won't go into it and bore you."
422,4,Good for the price,Good product but don’t get sucked in to HP instant ink. It’s a joke. It limits your own ability to use your printer as much as you want.
423,4,"Great printer, easy setup, not so good tech support!","I purchased this printer to replace a much older HP printer that finally bit the dust after many years of good service. Let me say at the outset that my desktop computer is an HP All-In-One, that I already had HP Smart installed on my PC, and that I was already an instant ink program subscriber for my old printer. That said, the setup was VERY easy. I plugged it in, chose a few options on the printer's screen (location, etc.), installed the ink cartridges that it came with, let it print a sample page to calibrate the ink heads, scanned it as instructed, and that was it. On the PC side of things, I used the HP Smart App to add a new printer, which it found almost instantly, entered a few settings, and it transferred my WiFi login information, and my instant ink account information to the new printer. Easy peasy! I'd read a few reviews before purchasing this printer and was a bit concerned that I'd have problems, but at least in my case, it was a piece of cake. The only hiccup in the process was trying to figure out how to remove my old printer the HP Smart App. I had to talk to two people and finally just figured it out myself. Honestly, how hard would lit be to have a ""remove"" button under your list of printers, and why did I have to deal with two ""chat"" people and finally resorted to figuring it out myself? Not a big deal, but they definitely need to up their App's user-friendliness and have a ""one-stop"" experience for getting customer service."
424,4,It’s pretty good,"Works great, when it works. Print quality is amazing; easy to setup. Connectivity is good. But what I mean by works great when it works, because when my printer goes into sleep mode it take a while to get it to pick up when I want to print. I have to unplug and plug to get it back on a perfect connection. Could be due to I do not use my printer very often"
425,4,"I thought I could use a flash drive to save my scanned docs and images, etc.!","I thought I could use a flash drive to save my scanned docs and images, etc.! Now I find I need to purchase some type of adapter to do this. Can anyone tell me what this is and where to buy it, hopefully on Amason.Thanks in advance for your help. Too bad they didn't show this in their ad or additional items to purchase this to make it fully functional."
426,4,Prints great,Love the printer the paper tray could have been a little more stable.
427,4,Printer,Working well. Does dbl sided print
428,4,It only comes with a 3 month supply of ink.,Printer works good. But it is advertizing 6 months of free ink when in reality the Instant Ink sheet that came with the printer only shows 3 months. Only if you sign up within 7 days of setting up the printer and activate HP+ and create an account with instant ink. then you have to remember to cancel it if you don't want more than just the trial period.Where is the 6 free months?
429,4,Relatively quick scanner,Scanner is quick.
430,4,Good Buy!,"The only issue I can say that I have with this printer is the paper drawer sticks when pulling or pushing it in. Otherwise, everything else runs smoothly."
431,4,Nice printer but I needed a fax on the printer to receive faxes,I liked it
432,4,Basic Printer.,"The product came before I expected it, it is a great value for the money."
433,4,Expected full ink cartridges when I received the printer NOT SO!,I like the printer.  Ordered it in May and have probably used it to print off no more than 50 copies and already can't print because the ink is too low!!!  I mean...how does this happen????
434,4,I discovered how it works! Mostly,I have been an HP customer forever and I can honestly say that this is the first time I have been completely disappointed. It works mostly meaning it will give you a printed copy but if you notice the printer is turned off because the panel will not shut off! It's just a constant bright light.  Update* I discovered how to keep the printer from spitting paper onto the floor so that stops the error message and constant bright light smh.
435,4,Printer itself is great with a couple of issues,"This printer at $99 is an incredible bargain. Print quality is great, love the doc feeder and wireless tech. There are issues, though. One, trying to install it with Win11 was an incredibly tedious exercise that should've taken 10 minutes. It took all morning to stumble across a configuration that worked. The scanning app is middling at best. If you don't keep an active scan up, it will time out immediately, and then when you try to scan again, it'll scan a blank page and leave your document sitting on the tray, so you have to do it twice. They should all Epson about a good scan interface. Geesh. I have used secondary market ink on printers for years with no issues, but I haven't tried it on this one. Reviews suggest that it's kind of a 50/50 proposition and that gets risky moneywise. All in all, once you get it up and running on your Win11 machine, it's a fine printer with lots of features, and dirt cheap compared to other all-in-ones."
436,4,"The printer type is 8015 e , but the setup guide is 8010 e","When I setup the printer, the setup guide confused me. Cause I can not lift the cartridge. I found the video from YouTube, 8015 e series . They can lift cartridge easily, but I couldn’t.. so I asked friends… finally I opened it successfully by lift it at the same time press a small button on the printer’s lift side. So why give me the 8010 e guide 😂😂 and then I connected the printer to my phone, it was read by 8010e. So am I pay 8015 e ‘s printer ,but I got a 8010e ? Please tell me what’s wrong 😑"
437,4,Not as good as the Envy 5000 it is replacing.,"Honestly, I'm probably going to box it up and return it. Even using the best level on print quality, the old HP envy 5000 normal quality is better."
438,4,Decent printer,Printer prints very nicely and was fairly easy to install.  Only issue it sometimes just doesn't respond almost  like it falls asleep.
439,4,Ink Supply,HP forces you to use their ink products…..otherwise the printer is very good
440,4,Sensitive to paper type,"The printer works great now that I've made friends with it. I had a horrible time with it picking up multiple pages at a time and printing on partial pages because of the pickup.  As long as I use the thicker paper (24lb) it has been great,  but super maddening with the lighter papers.The printer shelf and tray itself feels cheap, but the printer was quite inexpensive,  so..."
441,4,Printer meets my expectations.,Just use this printer for small printing jobs.  Do not use everyday.
442,4,Quiet with Quality,"I was pleasantly surprised with how quiet the printer operates in quiet mode and the print quality has been very good so far. The touch screen is adequate but it would be nicer if the icons were larger and in color. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the print speed is a bit on the slow side, but that may be associated with the quiet mode setting I use. I'm very satisfied with the printer overall."
443,4,Signal issues,Bought after years of my hp office 8600. This printer. Signal constantly needs a reboot. As it states printer not found. Other than that it’s a great size and it prints great.
444,4,It’s cool,It’s cool but kind of slow. Other than that it’s a pretty nice printer.
445,4,"So far, so good","Took me longer than expected to set it up and a little longer to connect it to my Wi Fi.  However,  thus far, no issues.  It's working fine."
446,4,Pretty fantastic,"I really needed a home printer for once in a while use.  I'm known to destroy things pretty quickly, but this has held up quite nicely.  Printed out the kiddos school pics instead of paying $6383919 through the school.  I also scan a lot of documents and that's been pretty great too.  Bonus - I set it up with my phone and can print all the things with a click."
447,4,"So far, so good!",I use this at home. I’ve only had it a short time(less than a month) but it’s done everything I need. Can’t give irt 5 stars for the same reason: haven’t had it long enough.
448,4,Great deal!,"You can definitely multitask w/ this printer , in black /white or color ! I work @ home so it’s a great addition to my « home office ! »"
449,4,Challenging to set up with MAC,Very happy with the printer once I got it set up.  But it was very challenging to set up.  Read reviews and followed the recommendation of first setting it up with my phone the linking my Mac lap top.  Had to call Tech Support.  Very friendly guys but not very helpful in setting it up.  Was told that my lap top was outdated.  Finally got it to work and now it works very well.
450,5,"So far so good, much better than others I tried","I'm a regular household user (ok, also a teacher, but not the kind who prints All The Things) but had an old Officejet because of a crazy black Friday deal back when black Friday deals were crazy. It died of old age and I thought I'd downgrade because budget. But I just couldn't go back to regular printers. I returned two out of frustration before deciding to just pay a little more and go back to Officejet, it's only been a couple of weeks but so far I don't think I'll have any regrets.Pros:+ Seems to be on sale often so it's not terribly more expensive than lower end printers.+ The print quality is very good. I'm getting a drop of those light horizontal lines, but just a bit, and I bet they could be ironed out if I had time to sit around with settings or something. But overall I'm much happier than I was with the other printers I tried, text is sharper and colors are more true.+ Paper tray is closed. I hate that all the new expensive printers these days have the paper sticking up from the back open to the elements. I can only assume their paper feeders get gummed up with dust pretty fast, and the papers themselves can't be too happy. The paper tray on this printer is great.+ It's not noisy, relative to others.+ HP Smart app is great, easy to use, has a nice set of functions.+ Had no issues with setup.+ So far seems to be picking up jobs just fine from my phone and laptop.Cons:- I really don't like the boxy design. I'm putting function over form but I really don't like it. And the front panel seems a bit flimsy, it's not the most important piece but my old Officejet didn't have a front panel that opened and I don't really see the point of this one as you need to lift the top to get inside anyway.- would love to have a paper bypass tray. Like if you want to print one envelope, it would be great to have a place to just feed that in rather than remove your whole paper stack, change the size in the tray, print your envelope, and then put all the paper back.- like I said before, I'm getting a drop of banding (is that what it's called? Tiny horizontal gaps?) When printing chunks of color. I'm not sure if this is fixable and the print quality is still the best I've seen in this price range, but it's a flaw.- the touch screen could be a little more responsive- That's... Really it so far. I had a lot more complaints with every other printer I tried.Neutral:~ Let's talk about instant ink. Many reviews had issues with this. They seem to not understand how the program works. It's not that complicated. No, you don't get six months worth of ink in the box with the printer. They will send the ink to your home as needed over six months if you sign up and give them your address. I haven't gotten to the end of the trial yet so I don't know if they actually brick your printer if you try to use generic ink, but they were very explicit about you agreeing not to do that when signing up. I have no issue with this because I did some math and I believe the instant ink actually is a better deal than even generic ink is. My old printer accepted generics (after an initial period of reluctance) and it wasn't all that exciting. And with subscription ink I won't need to worry about waste when the printer decides to clean the printheads (my old one did that a lot)I do think it feels scammy for them to make you commit at the outset to never use other ink for the life of the printer (what?!) But at the same time I'm comfortable with what they're offering. I'll be annoyed if they raise the prices though, and I think if they're making you commit upon purchase then they in turn should commit to grandfathering you into the ink prices as of the time of the commitment.~ Several times I've sent a print job from my phone, got an error message on my phone, while the job printed just fine. So it's good that the job printed fine, but it's weird and annoying that my phone thinks it didn't, and now I have an error notification sitting there, and if I'm not near the printer I don't know whether or not it actually printed or if I need to retry. I'll have to figure out how to make that stop. Maybe I'll need to uninstall and reinstall the phone app or something. Overall a very minor hiccup compared to the issues I had with other printers."
451,5,Gets the job done!,"I was under a strict timeline and needed a printer quick to complete new hire documents. It’s virtually impossible to find a printer over 4 stars. I choose this printer due to next day shipping. I expected the worst due to some of the reviews. I ordered the printer around 8pm and received it 4am the next morning.The setup was simple and easy to navigate. I liked there were no disks and it connected to my home wi-fi without the password.  I was able to connect my phone and computer. I was printing documents about 20 mins after opening the box. I choose the $6.99 ink delivery option to stay on top of refills.Cons: it’s huge & heavy. Scanning is slightly cumbersome, it would have been nice to come with paper included.Pros: looks nice like a mini version of huge stand alone office printer. Low noise level, printing is fast and easy to follow instructions. The touch screen is nice . The HP app helps with efficiency"
452,5,Great printer!,"For my use it is near perfect!  HP and Amazon were great in processing my order and getting it to me in a timely manner.  I love the printer being wireless, it scanning capability, its easy if use and the printer tray paper capacity.  It is quite efficient in the number of pages it can print per minute!  Overall durability is yet to be determined.  But, I expect to to perform well for a long, long time.  I also absolutely love the printer cartridge subscription service!  That is a wonderful thing!  Saves time, headaches, and resources."
453,5,Outstanding printer - don't be afraid of the HP ink cartridge cost or subscription offer,"I highly recommend both the 9010e and this printer, 8010e.  We have bought and replaced an Epson with ink tanks.  Ink tank sounds like a great idea.  The ink jets clog, are difficult to clean and never work correctly again, and it printed slow.  This HP 8010e comes with six months of free ink.  The printer contacts HP when ink is low, and they ship new cartridges free, without any user intervention.  It's seamless and one less thing to worry about.  The printer costs $100 and replacement ink set costs over that amount.  You are effectively getting 4200 pages of printing (the fee offer is 700 pages/mo.)over six months for the cost of paper.  The ink subscription is optional to either use from day 1 or after six months.Print quality is great.  18 PPM in B&W.  Quiet, fast, good footprint.  Oh and the wireless setup is easy, especially if this is the HP second printer.  Easy to print from phones.  Big paper tray.  I can't think of a negative.  HP is obviously trying to make it attractive to switch to a subscription revenue model, even offering printers/ink/paper all for a price per month.  I automatically don't like subscriptions, but this one works.  Hopefully HP won't raise prices and make it unattractive, but then I'll just cancel it and buy cartridges and the office superstores."
454,5,Great printer,I bought this to replace my cannon printer that quit working. This was easy to set up and the free ink program was easy to set up! This printer is rather large so make sure it fits where you want it!
455,5,"Excellent printer at an excellent price - and, personally, I LIKE the InstantInk subscription","Three things you should know about this printer:(1) It is an excellent printer for medium volume, home use. The print is clear and picture quality is very good, with accurate color rendering. I print 100 to 200 pages a month, which makes this perfect for me.(2) The price is excellent. I would have to pay two to three times more to get a printer with more features and barely-discernable better quality. Excellent bang for the buck here.(3) Many reviewers seem put off by the requirement that you subscribe to HP's InstantInk service. I have used that service since 2018 and am very happy with it. The service charges you each month based on how many pages you print. You sign up for a plan (e.g., I pay $7.41 per month for 100 pages; if I don't use all the pages, they carry over to the next month), HP tracks how many pages you print and your ink reserves, then sends new ink before you run out. Very convenient. Reasonable price. Best of all, you can easily increase or decrease the number of pages you subscribe to. If I know that I'll be printing more than usual during a particular period, I can increase the number of pages, avoiding extra fees. Then, when my need goes back to normal, I move it back to my usual subscription. If I take an extended vacation and won't be using my printer, I can change the plan to the minimum.I bought this printer to replace a five-year-old HP inkjet that worked wonderfully for years but was at the end of its life. I decided to stick with HP because my experience with them has been very good. I heartily recommend this one."
456,5,You can't beat HP printers,This is the 2nd time I've had this printer.  The first time I printed over a hundred thick cardstock funeral announcements and the feeder just stopped pulling in paper.  I liked the printer so much that I purchased it again and just plan on not using it for card stock since it's such a good printer and the fact that on the last printer i had already printed over 3000 pages so I'm sure it was at end of life anyway.  Im sorry but you cannot beat HP.
457,5,Worth every penny,"I purchased a refurbished HP printer for $80, and the packaging quality made it feel like a brand new product. The printer came with original HP ink cartridges, which alone are worth more than $80. As a bonus, it included a 6-month free HP Instant Ink subscription, providing an additional set of ink cartridges worth another $80.Overall, this refurbished printer purchase proved to be an excellent value for money. If you're considering a refurbished HP printer, I highly recommend it for the significant savings and included benefits."
458,5,Great home office printer!,"Great product- so EASY to install and printing has been easy and without issue.  Print from the home office computer and iPhone quickly and great quality.  It’s was easy to replace old printer and move this new one to the ink replenishment plan.  HP technology gets better every time.  But beware- the ink does leak when you first remove the orange tabs, so have something underneath to catch any drops."
459,5,Convenient,"This product has a wireless connect to your phone which is perfect! It is a good functional printer that is cute, and perfect for the price. It was so easy to set up and use. It does have a bit of sound, but it’s not loud !"
460,5,Wiggley Odd Printing When Printing Envelopes,"Overall, I would say this printer is a solid one for its price.The paper tray takes some getting used to.  (Push the buttons on both sides of the top of the computer's paper tray, and pull that off first.  Then pull the paper tray out.  Install the paper.  Push the paper tray back in.  To put the top of the tray back on, push the buttons, and slide it back on.)HP's instructions on how to install ink is missing one piece of the puzzle:  there is a ""button"" on the left-hand side of the lid that needs to be pushed to open the cover to get to the ink cartridges area.  (DO NOT FORCE OPEN THE LID, OR YOU WILL BREAK IT.)  I would suggest using the eraser end of a pencil or a pen that has not been pushed open for writing (hope that make sense) to push down on the button.  Push down and open the lid.  Otherwise, you are going to have to push really hard with your finger.But, the one thing that was very frustrating for me was printing envelopes within Word.  For example, I use #10 envelopes (generally referred to as business envelopes).  I have used the mailing/envelopes feature within Word for many many years, and so I know what I am doing.  Nevertheless, the print on the envelopes kept coming out with hashy-wiggley odd printing.  A postal carrier could never read it.After getting nowhere with HP Support, I decided to launch the HP Smart application that comes with the printer and resides on the computer.  I did so and just had a look around.  I noticed that the automatic hardware updates was not turned on.  I turned it on, and began to test again.Long story short, the printing of envelopes from Word was successful.  If you have a similar problem, you might want to try this.  However, after you have turned on the automatic hardware updates, wait for a few minutes (let's say five minutes).  Next, turn your printer off and then turn your computer off.  Wait for 30 seconds.  Turn your PRINTER on, then, after waiting a minute for the printer to be fully up and running, turn on your computer.This process helped me.  If you experience the above, I hope this helps you as well.Again, I find the printer to be overall fine in printing letters, scanning documents, and printing photos.  People have mentioned something about it making clicking noises when not in use.  I have no idea what they are talking about.  My HP OfficeJet 8015e printer is very quiet.  And, though it does not have the paper capacity of my much older and much bigger printer, I find that the amount of paper that I can put into the printer at a time is sufficient...and, most important, as I have grown older, the printer is not heavy.I hope this review helps you."
461,5,Loving this printer!,"We’ve had this printer for several months, and we couldn’t be happier.  It’s quiet, functional, and not too bulky for the home office.  We especially like the HP InstantInk that was offered with it."
462,5,Great quality. Wish I didn’t need an app,"Downloading the hp app is required for install. While it’s nice to print from my phone, I don’t like having a bunch of apps for things. Quality of printing is excellent so far."
463,5,Love it!,"This printer has exceeded my expectations!  I love how easy it was to setup, including the wireless connection and how fast it prints.  Great printer!"
464,5,Great product,"This printer is far and beyond the series 2700  HP printer we had.  I has more features, a touch screen, both side printing, and a good paper locker.  We liked the price and it came the next day as promised.  Upon unboxing, we followed the instructions (the ink was the easiest to install of any printer I've had)  The printer self installed itself with no issues.  All in all a good purchase."
465,5,EASY setup,This is the easiest printer to set up with a Mac that I have ever seen.  Usually I have to cuss a lot to get one to work.  This one was seamless.
466,5,Like a pro.,"Setting up this All-in-One Printer was a snap.  The Wi-Fi was easy to sync with my laptop, something I had been dreading as I am technologically challenged, so I was pleasantly surprised when the set-up went smoothly."
467,5,Awesome printer!,I bought this printer and subscribed to InstantInk subscription. I appreciate the quality of my copies and the ease it was to install.
468,5,"Easy to setup, quick and not heavy on the ink when printing.",
469,5,HP printer,Product as described.  Shipped overnight.easy set up and instructions.  HP has a great support team if a problem occurs.
470,5,So far so good,Can't believe it.....I followed the instructions and OMG everything worked perfectly.  Also I am approaching 80 years old which is a minor miracle ((not the age but the fact I understood the direction).  Thanks for a great affordable product (except for the ink prices of course).
471,5,Works well!,easy to use and it works well!
472,5,DO NOT sign up for hp+ software and this printer works great,"I see all the negative reviews and I felt the need to leave review and let people know regardless of what the set up tells you you do t have to sign up for hp+ software. It is super misleading and I would probably say borderline illegal the way that they portray that you have to sign up for the HP plus software during the set up. If you’re not text savvy it pretty much makes you think that you have to. I think this is a scam so that you Are defaulted into the AutoShip Inc. program which is nonsense. Just buy your ink on Amazon and many of the third-party inks work just fine the key is when you’re going through the set up on the little touchscreen on the printer and it tells you you have to scan the QR code. Otherwise you can’t go on and that it’s required  Just press a little? Symbol and it will tell you that you have to do this to proceed but also ask you if you want to cancel. Don’t let that scare you just press cancel. It will default to the home screen of the printer go through the alignment process that it gives you instructions for and then hit the little wireless button and connect it to your Wi-Fi at your house which is just requiring username and pass. After doing that, my phone automatically recognized it through air print on iPhone and my Mac automatically recognized it when going to printers and pressing add printer. That was it and printing no problem seems like all of the issues that arise are when using HP plus and trying to use that set up creates a host of problems and networks the printer back to HP. Just don’t do that and use it like a regular printer and you won’t have any issues. Really sucks that they force this on you and literally, use the words you cannot set up the printer if you don’t do this in the set up menu which is blatantly false. I bought this HP printer to replace a very similar all-in-one that I use for about 10 years with no problems. Finally the scanner we all started to give out, so bought this one to replace get past the set up and these HP all in ones seem to last forever. Good luck."
473,5,Print,Works Very Well
474,5,Fast Printing for the Right Price,"Great Printer! Started out slow, made me a bit nervous. But after logging in and out a couple times, it goes full speed now. Great system and easy to use and install."
475,5,Works like a dream! Buy it.,"Printer plugged in, downloaded whatever software that it needed and that was it, print away. Quality of the printing, I would give it 6 stars over just 5 stars. Blacks are CRISP and colors are the same, NO smearing at all. A+ Buy"
476,5,Setup was super easy for my Ubuntu 24.04 laptop,This was by far the easiest setup that I have ever had for a printer on my Ubuntu laptop that is running version 24..04 these days.  I went into the web interface for the printer and setup an admin password and a static IP on it.  I will be sticking with HP printers going forward since they seem to be Ubuntu friendly..
477,5,Easiest set up ever,I have never owned a printer so easy to set up and operate.  Plus came with an offer for no cost 6 months of.
478,5,Don’t subscribe to HP inkjet cartridge program,I really liked this printer and made the mistake of subscribing to the mfg promotional inkjet cartridge program. The printer has to be on the HP Smart App to work properly. I was getting crap cartridges from HP that leaked and were the smallest size they could sell me. I cancelled my subscription because of the poor quality of their product. I purchased brand new cartridges from the HP store and they cost more than the printer which was very reasonable price. The printer worked great for my needs. After installing the new HP inkjet cartridges my printer quit working. I received a notification from my HP account that my printer would not work anymore unless I resubscribe to their ink cartridge program. It is a scam. I am a senior citizen who is a disabled veteran and my attempts to get HP to remove my printer from their account was not successful. I did not have any options with Amazon customer service. They had no idea that HP was so aggressive with their product to be disabled because of the cancellation of their inkjet cartridge subscription. I have always had a great experience with HP. I learned a hard lesson. SVS
479,5,Woohoo! Love it.,"The best part of having this printer/scanner...When you have electric or internet disruptions it automatically resets itself. My old printer was a b***h to reset after the slightest disconnect. So far there isn't anything I dislike. Setup was simple, all the features are just what I needed. Would definitely buy again."
480,5,Easy,"Wow! I cannot believe how easy this was to set up. I'll bet I had it up, connected and printing in under 5 minutes. So far I'm very impressed and happy with this printer."
481,5,Great printer,Easy setup. Excellent quality printer
482,5,Great quality,Synced well with bluetooth and everything else.
483,5,nice unit,For my teacher son who wanted a fast reliable printer. He is very satisfied with it!
484,5,La impresora de la familia,Me gustó porque tiene muchas opciones:  posibilidad de impresión remota desde cualquier parte de la casa y desde cualquier dispositivo dentro de la red.
485,5,I love this new printer,It works real good. I have no problem with it.
486,5,Perfect!,"Super easy setup, really fast, I love it! Great price! This fixed my life!"
487,5,"price, quality, convenience,  and your response time",n a
488,5,HP printer,This printer is very affordable… And I waited for it to go on sale which made it better for me… It does everything I need to do. For a small office it works well.
489,5,Works Good,Very easy to use!
490,5,"Quick to receive,",Everything installed well.  Received the same day I ordered it.  thanks
491,5,You'll not be disappointed in this copier.,"This product is easy to use, and gives excellent copies."
492,5,great machine,"excellent value ,perfect for home office . Delivered on time ,as described"
493,5,Printer,I love this printer. It’s very efficient
494,5,HP Printer,Easy to use. Works great.HP will automatically send me ink and paper as needed at a reasonable monthly charge. Service is excellent
495,5,"Easy Set-up, Very Pleased so Far","After reading the reviews, I had braced myself for a long and tedious set-up process when I received my new printer yesterday. My previous HP printer is so old that they no longer make ink cartridges for it. My computer's operating system is old enough that it won't let me download the HP Smart program. So I had low expectations.I followed the directions to plug in, add paper and ink cartridges and set up the printer. I downloaded the HP Smart app to my phone because that's the only way to connect it to a Wi-Fi network that I can tell. I declined to create an account with HP, or to enroll in the free ink offer. I manually added the printer as my default to my computer. And to my amazement, everything works!I've been able to print from my phone, print from my computer, and scan things from the printer app on my computer. If you try to use the control panel on the printer to scan things it will tell you that you have to have an HP smart account, but you can still scan from the computer printer icon.Other than HP's insistence on trying to get you to create an account on their app to use a printer, the printer itself works very well. The installation of ink was easy, the actual paper tray holds quite a bit of paper and the printing is fast. I didn't bother putting it in quiet mode since it says it slows down the printing speed and honestly it's not that loud to begin with. The display is nice and bright and everything printed neatly. Unless I start having problems I would have to say this is a really good printer."
496,5,Great Improvement over Epson and Previous HP Printers,"This replaced a WF2950 which, after a firmware upgrade, would no longer user 3rd party ink nor was the scanner recognized by Linux.  By contrast this printer was heavy, I'd estimate three times as much, but it is robust.  I accidentally dropped onto a wooden floor from about 4ft and it just bounced, no parts fell off or cracked.  It worked under Linux with zero extra software, just plugin and go, both scanner and printer.  The print quality was very good out of the box, almost laser printer quality.  The blank ink cartridge is larger than the others which is an intelligent design change because black always runs out first.  From an ergonomics standpoint, the monochrome display is bland but the overall appearance is very simple and aesthetically pleasing.  It has a reasonable size paper tray input and output.  The Epson lacked an output tray.  Overall a very good value for the money."
497,5,Nice!,Good for the money!
498,5,Great printer,Awesome
499,5,The printer is very good.,The order arrived on time. Very easy to install. Easy to use. The printer comes with cartridges. Very happy. The kids print every day for school.
