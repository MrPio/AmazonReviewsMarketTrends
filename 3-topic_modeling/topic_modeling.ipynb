          "I have no issue with this because I did some math and I believe the instant ink actually is a better deal than even generic ink is.",

          "I went to the HP ink web page and canceled my $5.99 a month subscription ( a week later they sent me an email informing me that the price was increased to $6.99 a month), and that is when I was informed that if I cancel my ink subscription my printer cartridges will be turned off, and now my \"free\" ink is USELESS and my printer will not print until I replace the full ink cartridges, and a new set of cartridges for the printer will cost About $85.00UpdateAfter I replaced all of the ink cartridges, and turned my printer back on again it said it needed to be set up again.",

          "You sign up for a plan (e.g., I pay $7.41 per month for 100 pages; if I don't use all the pages, they carry over to the next month), HP tracks how many pages you print and your ink reserves, then sends new ink before you run out.",
          "Have had 1 other hp printer for 2 years and the Ink comes before I need it.Signed up for the instant ink program since I already have another hp printer thats enrolled in that program.",
          "Price the HP brand ink replacement to make sure this is your best option.",

          "But… if you refill or install a third party cartridge the printer locks up when it recognizes a non HP cartridge.",
          "If you use the ink you are not permitted to buy third-party ink to replace it, meaning HP will charge you up to $180 to get a full set of ink (XL at Staples).HP requires you to connect to them even if you simply want to scan to computer, the class action suit against them is warranted.",
          "the Machine basically stops working when you try to insert non-HP ink.",
          "Less than 200 copies before 3 of the four cartridges were out of ink.",
          "Now I don’t need to go to the Office supply store or order online hoping that they have my cartridge in stock or if the ink will be here on time.",
          "I put the XL cartridge in there and it has locked down the device saying it won’t print unless I put the same stock type in.",
          "I do a lot of printing and I generally am able to get 3 to 4 years usage.",
          "However, I also didn’t want to pay for HP’s toner at twice or triple the cost of competitor’s toner, which worked just as well and seemed to last just as long as the “genuine” cartridges.",
          "I have never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment than I have with this printer - so much so that I am writing a detailed review for the first time in years.Here are the more salient details:-Will not accept ink that is not made by HP which costs about twice as much as other ink.",
          "Not anymore.-You can log into your device on a computer to disable cartridge protection, though.",
          ")over six months for the cost of paper.",

          "After 19 pages, the replacement toner cartridges were more than the cost of the printer.",
          "I paid for instant ink for months and everything ran smoothly.Then, for no apparent reason, I'd go to use the printer one day and the touchscreen would just say \"cartridge cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP instant ink\" ...even though the instant ink subscription was still very much current and active.",
          "A bit of research will reveal HP is being sued over their ink scam and why you should NOT agree to firmware updates when prompted...research I wish I had done.",
          "hat the ink the printer came with would last 3 months is totally inaccurate.",
          "HP graciously allowed me to change my plan to10 pages a month.",
          "You run out of ink You got to take out a loan just to buy it.",
          "After 3 months of sporadic use I'm already getting warnings that the magenta and cyan cartridges are running low.",

          "I cancelled the Instant Ink and I have a week to buy ink (even though the cartridges in the printer are about 80% full) because they're going to not let the printer use those cartridges...which in a way doesn't matter since I can't use the printer anyway, but still, very wasteful and insecure of them.Anyway, there's a bunch of other printers out there, so why add extra stress in your life by buying an HP who want you for your Instant Ink subscription and not because they want to bring happiness into your life when you can provide your kids a fun coloring sheet in 1 minute.",
          "My previous HP printer is so old that they no longer make ink cartridges for it.",
          "I don't trust that HP is going to ship at the point that I actually need the ink, plus it has a fee regardless from what I can tell.",
          "We’ve been very happy with them and with our ink “deal” we can print as many copies as wanted/needed.",
          "You positively HAVE to use HP ink, which is so much more expensive than others that should be compatible.",

          "I finally got it to enter into into wi-fi setup mode (but I don't know how I did it).",

          "The tech insists that there is a problem with my switch/router causing the issues.",
          "I know it is old, however the irony of this is that the Printer will not recognize my router password due to Network being a WPA2 it only will accept WPA which is as old as my O.S!",
          "The wifi connection is strong, but often times printing from iOS devices just goes into a black hole where the printer never wakes up to print.",
          "During research to figure out why the printer could not be found by Windows 10, I ran across a note about a 2 hr timer and the need to reset wi-fi setup mode.",
          "I tried for nearly two hours to set up the printer (touted for it's easy set up) on a brand new Windows 11 HP computer but in the end had to reach out to support because it simply would not find my wireless network with the modem and router not 5 feet away.",
          "I tried to set this up on my iPad and got a message that I had to do it on a laptop.",
          "It said it had a poor WiFi connection.",

          "I forgot to cancel it sure, but it’s not that big of a deal.However, I tried to scan my own ID at home for something I needed right away, and the printer displays a message saying that there is a problem with my HP account and I cannot use my printer until I resolve it!!",

          "It will not scan from the document feeder.",
          "The unit does not do two-sided copies does not stay in sync if you do more than five pages good luck it'll print the wrong side get confused first two will come out good that's it it can't do more than two pages at a time",

          "If you don't keep an active scan up, it will time out immediately, and then when you try to scan again, it'll scan a blank page and leave your document sitting on the tray, so you have to do it twice.",

          "I am pretty computer savvy but trying to get this to scan and or print envelopes was a nightmare.",

          "You can turn on two sided printing and all that does is when it prints it will turn the paper over for you which doesn’t help because you have to turn it back over to put it back in the paper feeder to do the other side, two sided prints have to be done manually.",

          "I also got the six month ink deal, it is five dollars you get six months of extra ink, so that’s a pretty great deal itself.",

          "Best part  is for 6 months you get free ink and then for a small cost you can have them continue to have ink sent to you.",
