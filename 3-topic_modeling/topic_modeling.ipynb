          "By contrast this printer was heavy, I'd estimate three times as much, but it is robust.",
          "Why did it have to do it when you wanted to print something?I just bought this model (8015e) because, for the price, these printers are great for home AND office use, AND because I already had 2 brand new sets of ink cartridges stocked up that weren't cheap and I didn't want to just toss them.",
          "Long story, TLDR: I got to use the printer for one project and the next 4 months were a series of problems.I bought this on sale and heard good things about the printer from friends and family.",

          "You can escalate this to the highest member of your support team, but I have emailed exes who haven't replied or said that it was out of their hand since I purchased it on Amazon, but it's same as going to target or bestbuys that offer price matching up to 14 days, 30 with my red card membership.",
          "It opens up in the browser and depending on what you use as a browser, you may run into issues.",

          "The ink jets clog, are difficult to clean and never work correctly again, and it printed slow.",
          "Regardless, the instructions require that you have better than average computer skills.",
          "It says a USB cable can be used but doesn't give clear instructions.",
          "Some features are a little hard to figure out but with time I think will be a great printer.",

          "It also stops working unless you use the high dollar HP cartridges.",

          "Overall a very minor hiccup compared to the issues I had with other printers.",
          "Honestly, how hard would lit be to have a \"remove\" button under your list of printers, and why did I have to deal with two \"chat\" people and finally resorted to figuring it out myself?",
          "I know that's how they make money but I certainly expected to get more out the ink cartridges than only ~33% of what they advertise.",

          "I am amazed, and seriously, HP is truly the best printer out there for the home office.",
          "The app is excruciatingly slow already, but then it feels the need to launch my browser and take me to the HP website for all kinds of things that ought to be available at the printer itself, and I cannot believe that the website for a huge company like HP can be so slow and clumsy.",
          "Who are they going to sell any data they collect from how their printers are being used?My new research says to go with Lexmark or Brother with the latter being more favorable.",
          "After not updating the firmware for a few months if you ever disconnect the printer or have a power outage you will have to go through resetting it up again and jumping through a bunch of hoops to be able to use your refills or 3rd party ink.",

          "Almost like it goes into some sort of sleep mode.",
          "Now I’m wasting a ton of ink cleaning and printing test pages.",
          "This is by far the worst printer or piece of equipment in general I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing.Everything worked fine for a few weeks, but once the ink ran out everything went to hell.",
          "First it wouldn't communicate well with my PC - on and off whether it would or not.",
          "This is a SHELL GAME!WTF?",
          "Right now I have going on 3 hours trying to get it to print and have only gotten it to print about 10 pages.",
          "So it's good that the job printed fine, but it's weird and annoying that my phone thinks it didn't, and now I have an error notification sitting there, and if I'm not near the printer I don't know whether or not it actually printed or if I need to retry.",
          "This printer is you pay for what you get!",
          "I’m already replacing the black cartridge and haven’t had the printer but a month",
          "You cannot set it up and get it to print without using HP+ and the app.",

          "I'm getting a drop of those light horizontal lines, but just a bit, and I bet they could be ironed out if I had time to sit around with settings or something.",

          "If it hadn’t been for troubleshooting support, would’ve just bought a new printer.If you’re on a budget & looking for a reasonably priced wi-Fi printer copier scanner e-fax w/ subscription features; supports multiple OS platforms too, I would suggest this printer for smaller print jobs only.",

          "If I know that I'll be printing more than usual during a particular period, I can increase the number of pages, avoiding extra fees.",
          "I certainly hope I’m not going to be forced to purchase another printer!",
          "First I want to note that it works well but features are not any different than much older unit it replaced.",
          "Wait for 30 seconds.",
          "Finally got it to install the wireless drivers, but still having trouble getting it to install drivers for USB cable.",

          "It worked for months flawlessly.",
          "I may have just gotten a bad egg.",
          "The only issue I can say that I have with this printer is the paper drawer sticks when pulling or pushing it in.",
          "And THEN having to endure all of it again and again every time a new ink cartridge is inserted and for the periodic maintenance cycles it goes through, etc.",
          "This decision has turned out to be one of the most frustrating experiences in my history of printer purchases.Since purchasing the HP printer, I have yet to successfully use it.",
          "I noticed that the automatic hardware updates was not turned on.",
          "If you need a printer, this is ok.",
          "I have spent 2 1/2 months trying to solve this set up issue to no avail.",
          "This printer is definitely worth the price.",
          "This printer is pretty noisy while printing, but gets the job done.",
          "This was a good printer for the most part.I just had a problem with it and I tried calling the HP support to nit much avail.I really need a printer at home which is making me buy a new one right now.i have also changed the brand ..see how that goes",
          "The printer arrived with a defect on the paper catcher, but it was workable, so I began using it.",

          "means  ?",
          "I have owned several Hp printers over the years and have never experienced the  poor customer service or had such a frustrating experience with a printer.",
          "I'm leaving a few steps out of that story because there were so many minor problems that it would be impossible for you to follow everything.",
          "After trying everything to troubleshoot I reached out to customer support only to find out that I need a USB 2.0 cable, which of course did not come with the machine so now I need to spent even more money and wait for delivery.",
          "Anyone experiencing this issue too?",
          "I've had HP printers for as long as I can remember.",
          "It pulls multiple sheets at once from the tray causing glitches in the printing thereby wasting ink and paper.",
          "Finally got it to work and now it works very well.",
          "You need to download software, you need to create an account.",
          "You just have to break it and get something else.Oh, if you stayed this long, I ended up recycling the printer after a few hits with a bat and ripping out any circuit boards I could find.",
          "While this is a great deal for the price, getting the printer connected to wifi, my laptop, and my iphone was really clunky.",
          "I didn't want to risk that and didn't like the control factor from HP, so didn't sign up.",
          "My only issue is that the thing doesn’t seem to last too long.",

          "I bought this printer 3 months ago and the ink has already dried up.",
          "I am docking the product 2 stars for the terrible software performance and the incessant and slow \"grinding\" the printer feels the need to do all the time.",
          "States that ink is included in the box.",
          "It could take a few minutes before it finished doing that, which was annoying.",
          "Don't be duped into believing cheap ink works, HP controls that.",
          "Second one came from HP and found out it has a speck of a flaw on the automatic document feeder lens that causes a line down the entire page when copying.",

          "Fits my needs.",
          "I bought this to replace my cannon printer that quit working.",
          "I've used HP since my very first printer, and I believe in brand loyalty when earned.",
          "It’s been a year since purchased this WiFi printer, copier, scanner, e-fax; felt time to give a thorough review so consumers can make an informed decision on whether or not this would be good option.",
          "Eventually, will replace w/ something more durable; capability of printing multiple pages w/o jamming.",
          "If the printing has heavy color, must wait for drying time before the page exits the tray.",
          "The Canon I replaced works better .",
          "I finally got fed up but missed the 30-day return window since the majority of issues started happening about 40 days after purchase.",
          "They have certainly lost a customer because of their decisions to require only HP cartridges being used in a consumable product!",
          "I'm just miffed because I was led to believe I didn't have to.",
          "I like the printer.",
          "We have three large HP printers and this was just for a short term location that didn't print much.",
          "There are no buttons to push or anything to get the notice off of the screen.",
          "I have decided to return.",
          "But not so bulky that it's obnoxious.",
          "I’ve been using HP printers for over 20 years and have owned more than 10, but this is by far the worst one I’ve ever had.",
          "I spent hours on it myself trying to figure it out.",
          "In fact, gave my old one to a friend who is still using it in her business.",
          "It won't find the papers, so it won't \"grab\" to print and when canceled, it won't stop trying to print so it wastes ink.",
          "I have looked inside to see if I can see anything on the pathway, but don't see anything.",
          "If I had seen the fine print, I would have gotten something else.",
          "I was printing documents about 20 mins after opening the box.",
          "I needed something in a pinch that would suit my needs in this particular printer filled that gap nicely.",
          "Ridiculous",
          "I thought this printer would last much longer for my occasional printing.",
          "I have had the new one since about December or January and it is the worst printer I have ever had and between this trouble and HP+, it makes me want to never buy an HP again.",
          "I love everything thing about it!",
          "This all in one printer is compact and easy to use.",
          "Granted I do print a lot of things on a daily basis, but the big issue is you have to use the HP refills which are expensive, and I am having to replace them once a month.",
          "When the cartridges finally arrived, the printer gives me a message that says it wanted me to insert the \"starter cartridges that came with the printer\".",
          "So far I'm very impressed and happy with this printer.",
          "I will never buy another HP printer for the rest of my life.It seemed to perform well at the outset, but just two days ago, the black print quickly faded.It TOLD me I had ample black ink.",
          "If you don't, it won't work as it's not compatible.",
          "Maybe that's the reason for the difficulty.",
          "I got this for my daughter she is in college and she prints stuff sometimes our old printer was not keeping up anymore.",
          "So, if you change paper often or use a lot of paper - given a choice, pick a different HP model.",
          "It is noisy.",
          "They can lift cartridge easily, but I couldn’t.. so I asked friends… finally I opened it successfully by lift it at the same time press a small button on the printer’s lift side.",
          "Easy to use.",

          "Sigh.",
          "Prior to recently purchasing this printer, I had another HP printer that lasted 8 years and it was awesome.",
          "Connects with all our devices with ease.",
          "They even make a part to fix the broken leg that costs 15 bucks, it's an obvious failure point in the machine.",
          "It told me my ink had been updated.",
          "Don’t let that scare you just press cancel.",
          "Sorry for any problems i did.",
          "The Black XL cartridge is 50% of what I paid for eh printer.",
          "Yes, they were costly, but no more and much less than some of the others that go with other printer brands.So far, what I have noticed is that with this model, the maintenance cycle is much quicker and probably takes no more time than printing an extra document.",
          "In the rare chance it prints the first time I will continue to get a pop up on my phone saying, the printer is busy and click try again or cancel, this pop up happens as I am watching it print what I just sent to the printer.I beg of you to not purchase this printer it will only give you headaches.The ink life is abysmal on this printer, I am able to printer around 20 pages and it’s telling me I am out of int… I am shocked with the price you pay for this ink in general.I would have returned this printer but by the time I actually needed to print something it was out of the Amazon return window.Overall this printer is probably the most useless item sitting in my office at the moment.",
          "He wanted $199 to fix my issue and my printer isn't even a year old yet.",
          "Very happy.",
          "I've set up many devices before, but this one.",
          "Up until this one, never had a problemSet up was a bi#@h. Finally had to use wire instead of wireless, still took hours ti get it working.",
          "To get the same quality as the 10 yr old printer, I bought a printer that was more than twice the price!",
          "This may be my 5th HP printer and well they changed the Sofware and I cannot connect it to my HP computer.",
          "Let me say at the outset that my desktop computer is an HP All-In-One, that I already had HP Smart installed on my PC, and that I was already an instant ink program subscriber for my old printer.",
          "If you go that route up in the new ink when it arrives or your printer will not work.",
          "Really awesome printer!",
          "The printer works fine and the cost was resonable, but it took me a day and a half and much frustration before the printer began to work properly.",
          "Great printer!",
          "I’ve used H P printers for years.",
          "I was replacing it with an older HP printer that worked fine until my system turned to 5G.",
          "(That's really no one's fault, I'm not even mad at the kids) The process for reordering the cartridges was extremely difficult and it took me a week of trying to get in touch with someone to send me more ink.",
          "You have to download their program for printing, you have to download for scanning, you have to download for faxing.",
          "The set up was a little tedious but then I reverted to my knowledge of my past HP model.",
          "We spent over 50 minutes to get it to work again.I found customer service to be horrible.",

          "I would recommend this printer.Updated 6/29/24After having this printer for some time, I am now having buyers regret.",
          "I ordered this printer in October 2023 to replace the previous HP All in One I had that gave up the ghost in under 2 years.",
          "My issue was never addressed or even offered any extra services for this printer that has dropped on price over 60 dollars total after just 2 days purchase on Amazon who also dropped price when I contacted customer service who said they don't offer price protection and who have to contact hp.",
          "Guess what?",
          "The feed mechanism for document scanning/copying function broke on the first one (8010) after about a year.",

          "Good product but don’t get sucked in to HP instant ink.",

          "It's so quick and not worth the cost.",
          "Be careful with HP Printers.",
          "So if quality scans, especially for business or formal documents is important to you, I would skip this printer.",
          "VOILA, it works correctly now.Thank You HP for wasting hours of my time, blaming apple for your product failure, and leaving me on the hook for a brand new printer that wouldn’t work.",

          "I tried to load non-HP ink cartridges but it would not work at all.....I could buy a new one instead of ink.",
          "HP controls when and how you purchase ink.Any ink you received as part of the original purchase  is rendered incompatible with the machine if you purchase/buy any new ink by any means other than the scheme rules of HP.",
          "If you do, just be prepared for the ink nightmare above.",
          "And while there is a push by HP to sign up for a regular ink supply, at a monthly fee, you can delay that decision for six months.",
          "We’ve been very happy with them and with our ink “deal” we can print as many copies as wanted/needed.",
          "I shouldn't have to buy ink that soon.",
          "I cancelled the Instant Ink and I have a week to buy ink (even though the cartridges in the printer are about 80% full) because they're going to not let the printer use those cartridges...which in a way doesn't matter since I can't use the printer anyway, but still, very wasteful and insecure of them.Anyway, there's a bunch of other printers out there, so why add extra stress in your life by buying an HP who want you for your Instant Ink subscription and not because they want to bring happiness into your life when you can provide your kids a fun coloring sheet in 1 minute.",
          "But… if you refill or install a third party cartridge the printer locks up when it recognizes a non HP cartridge.",
          "If you don’t print you don’t receive any ink.",
          "However, I also didn’t want to pay for HP’s toner at twice or triple the cost of competitor’s toner, which worked just as well and seemed to last just as long as the “genuine” cartridges.",
          "After 3 months of sporadic use I'm already getting warnings that the magenta and cyan cartridges are running low.",
          "Ordered it in May and have probably used it to print off no more than 50 copies and already can't print because the ink is too low!!!",
          "You positively HAVE to use HP ink, which is so much more expensive than others that should be compatible.",
          "Not anymore.-You can log into your device on a computer to disable cartridge protection, though.",
          "For some reason my old HP all in one printer has decided (all of a sudden) that the ink cartridge is not compatible.",
          "I've spent an additional $80 on ink, despite still actively paying for instant ink (and having entire, brand new cartridges from instant ink sitting right beside my printer) and this thing won't connect to my perfectly functional internet because it WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A WIFI CONNECTION OPTION.Could not be more frustrated and disappointed in this product.",
          "The ink running out very fast and the cost of ink for replacement is what SUCKS.",
          "The e Series locks you into only HP Ink.",
          "I declined to create an account with HP, or to enroll in the free ink offer.",
          "When the starter toner ran out, that’s when I discovered that HP was taking things to another level…I popped in the 3rd party cartridge, expecting the machine to chastise me for using “non-genuine” toner but ultimately letting me proceed.",
          "After 19 pages, the replacement toner cartridges were more than the cost of the printer.",
          "If you use the ink you are not permitted to buy third-party ink to replace it, meaning HP will charge you up to $180 to get a full set of ink (XL at Staples).HP requires you to connect to them even if you simply want to scan to computer, the class action suit against them is warranted.",
          "I don't trust that HP is going to ship at the point that I actually need the ink, plus it has a fee regardless from what I can tell.",
          "I always use HP ink but did not do the HP ink subscription since I do not want to limit my options and want to order ink when I know I need it.",
          "When I caught the subscription for a product I wasn't receiving I notified HP--thinking they would refund my money for cartridges never received and help me understand how to unenroll from the subscription program.",
          "I don't use much color ink.",
          "I have never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment than I have with this printer - so much so that I am writing a detailed review for the first time in years.Here are the more salient details:-Will not accept ink that is not made by HP which costs about twice as much as other ink.",
          "HP graciously allowed me to change my plan to10 pages a month.",
          "You run out of ink You got to take out a loan just to buy it.",
          ")over six months for the cost of paper.",
          "This may apply to all HP printers, but HP has been on a quest to force those who buy their printers to use “genuine HP toner.”  In the past, their machines could detect when a “non HP” cartridge was being used, but this just generated warnings about the quality of non-genuine cartridges being dubious, and the machine would not detect the toner level for you (when it was probably quite capable of doing so).Fine, I don’t fault HP for wanting to sell its own toner.",
          "Connecting from certain devices is impossible.Second, more troubling - generic inks which are cheap will NOT work.",
          "You'll be paying the highest cost in the marketplace for ink.",
          "The \"3 months\" of ink included actually turned out to be 19 pages.",
          "Feeling screwed, I proceeded to enroll in HP’s “instant ink” program—under duress—while I decide what to do longer term, as I definitely don’t want another monthly subscription for anything on my credit card (much less for printer toner!!",
          "Did not know about needing to only use hp ink",
          "My previous HP printer is so old that they no longer make ink cartridges for it.",
          "The advertising states 6 months of ink... Used printer 7 times and was out of ink.",
          "If it gets low on paper I'll buy more.",
          "We will see how long the second round of ink goes.Good printer, crappy ink.",
          "Ordered ink that fits through another company that was budget friendly but HP can detect copy cats and rejects it.",
          "I put the XL cartridge in there and it has locked down the device saying it won’t print unless I put the same stock type in.",
          "If I take an extended vacation and won't be using my printer, I can change the plan to the minimum.I bought this printer to replace a five-year-old HP inkjet that worked wonderfully for years but was at the end of its life.",
          "It lasts two weeks and I only print maybe 4 things a day.",
          "After having this printer for 1 year and being enrolled in the Insta Ink subscription - I've only received one set of replacements.",
          "If you have problems with a cartridge, you can't just go buy a new HP cartridge - it won't work - you have to wait for a new one to be shipped, so effectively you have no printer.",
          "Yes, with the 3rd party cartridge.",
          "I received a notification from my HP account that my printer would not work anymore unless I resubscribe to their ink cartridge program.",
          "We called HP several times and they had us go in the phone circle for over an hour.We had to have a contract for ink, and HP MONITORS what is printed and when.There is not ONE good thing I can say about this machine.For the most part, I have to e-mail my print jobs to my work address, and print it there, or send it to my wifes e-mail and have her print it.",
          "It rejects anything except an actual HP cartridge.",
          "At about the 5 and a half month point I get an email saying my \"free\" ink period is about to expire, now I have printed about 50 pages over the 6-month period.",
          "However, it means that the ink provided as replacement cannot be used because I am no longer subscribed to HP Instant Ink.",
          "However, unlike before, the machine literally refused to print, displaying a message to that effect on the screen and stating that it was due to the non-HP cartridge.",
          "I like having the Ink come before I need it, it’s very convenient.",
          "Of course, the HP toners are ridiculously expensive.",
          "I do a lot of printing and I generally am able to get 3 to 4 years usage.",
          "After 4 weeks ALL ink cartridges are spent.",
          "Purchased HP ink, all good so far.",
          "Now I don’t need to go to the Office supply store or order online hoping that they have my cartridge in stock or if the ink will be here on time.",
          "Of course it only takes branded ink cartridges so I cannot replace it without paying the full price.",
          "You sign up for a plan (e.g., I pay $7.41 per month for 100 pages; if I don't use all the pages, they carry over to the next month), HP tracks how many pages you print and your ink reserves, then sends new ink before you run out.",
          "Have had 1 other hp printer for 2 years and the Ink comes before I need it.Signed up for the instant ink program since I already have another hp printer thats enrolled in that program.",
          "I have no issue with this because I did some math and I believe the instant ink actually is a better deal than even generic ink is.",
          "Instead I was challenged that I really was receiving the ink and just trying to get out of paying for it--and after I cancelled the subscription my printer was made unusable by HP with a message on my printer stating \"The indicated cartridges cannot be used until printer is enrolled in HP Instant Ink.\"",
          "I went to the HP ink web page and canceled my $5.99 a month subscription ( a week later they sent me an email informing me that the price was increased to $6.99 a month), and that is when I was informed that if I cancel my ink subscription my printer cartridges will be turned off, and now my \"free\" ink is USELESS and my printer will not print until I replace the full ink cartridges, and a new set of cartridges for the printer will cost About $85.00UpdateAfter I replaced all of the ink cartridges, and turned my printer back on again it said it needed to be set up again.",
          "I tried to take a guess at my printer usage a was I off so without any issue during there trial period I changed my plan.",
          "Runs out of ink quickly And in is only available online",
          "You either have to pay for the top tier hp printer ink and have their service and agree to all their terms to keep your printer even working.",
          "Not HP.-In the past, HP would let you \"disable cartridge protection\" on the printer itself which would allow you to use generic ink brands.",
          "The ink runs out pretty fast.",
          "HP forces you to use their ink products…..otherwise the printer is very good",
          "And, of course, if I want to buy replacement cartridges from HP, it costs nearly as much as the printer did.",
          "the Machine basically stops working when you try to insert non-HP ink.",
          "If your printer says it doesn't recognize your aftermarket ink, shut it off, disconnect the printer completely and turn it back on.",
          "You have to purchase their expensive ink if you run out.",
          "You are required to sign up for the monthly HP+ subscription program that includes ink for 6 months (for me) - and paper if you like (rip-off) and are limited to a set number of printouts a month or you are charged extra.",
          "hat the ink the printer came with would last 3 months is totally inaccurate.",
          "You can over come this shock if you choose to own it rather that lease it, by enrolling in the instant ink and or paper services.",
          "But beware- the ink does leak when you first remove the orange tabs, so have something underneath to catch any drops.",
          "If one subscribes, the printer firmware is forever and irrevocably changed so that the printer can only use genuine HP ink.",
          "Tried half price bargain brand ink after the 3 month free ink HP supplies, but the printer rejected all cartridges, returned for a refund.",
          "I have used secondary market ink on printers for years with no issues, but I haven't tried it on this one.",
          "The printer contacts HP when ink is low, and they ship new cartridges free, without any user intervention.",
          "I cancelled the plan after a year and began getting error messages saying the ink cartridges were not recognized (even though HP sent them to me) and the only way to get the printer to work again is to resubscribe or go purchase new cartridges.",

          "I finally got it to enter into into wi-fi setup mode (but I don't know how I did it).",
          "The wifi connection is strong, but often times printing from iOS devices just goes into a black hole where the printer never wakes up to print.",
          "Now, imagine putting in a secure wifi password on that bad boy every time you print.I don't print often, this stays at the house, so whatever required links it has to HP probably get severed between prints.",

          "The printer goes offline for no apparent reason; scanning is not available; my iPhone cannot find the printer, but my laptop can; printing (when it is working) takes a very long time to happen.",
          "Each time I entered in my Wi-Fi password OR set it to automatically detect it, in the next click for installing, the moment I clicked I noticed my Wi-Fi cut out and it eventually give me an error message that the program \"can't connect to my Wi-Fi network.",
          "Due to Web search and learning WPA info aforementioned and why it will not accept my Router Pword, just gives Error.It does however Print wireless via a short code the Printer offers and then to fill in a blank at driver install time.",

          "In the end, she told me that it would not work with 5G band from my internet provider so I would need to get a new router.",
          "When I explained to the tech support rep that the printer was WIFI only (no Ethernet port) he suggested that the printer was too far (15 feet) from the router and that it had to be within 10 feet of the router.",
          "When I asked the rep how weak signal would cause the printer to lose its IP address, he could not answer the question but insisted that I would need to get up from my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it and walk into the next room to turn on my printer, then walk back to my desk with my Wi-Fi connected computer on it to send the print job to the printer, and again walk back to the printer to retrieve the printed documents from the printer that is nice and comfy snuggled in right next to my Wi-Fi router.Now when I turn my new Brother printer on it says ready to print every time.",
          "I have to unplug and plug to get it back on a perfect connection.",
          "Signal constantly needs a reboot.",
          "At times I had my mobile hotspot turned off and it would reconnect with no issue at all.",
          "Every other time I go to use this printer, it erases my wifi info and demands that I setup the printer through the HP app again from square one.",
          "It was easy to set up with both wifi and direct line to an old HP desktop.",
          "I could not connect this HP printer wirelessly to my HP (3 year old) wireless tower.",
          "It said it had a poor WiFi connection.",
          "And to be clear, my router was NOT the problem.",
          "So no Handshake unless I turn my network into WPA and then maybe I can get it on my Network.My other Laptop is Win10 and the drivers installed fine but cannot see it on the Network when looking for Device>Printer.",
          "For example, for a device which may require the WPS of the unit, it only briefly comes up when trying to connect.",
          "I decided to go with a different brand that can be hooked up via USB if the wireless fails.",
          "However, if you want to print wifi, then forget it.",
          "Today it's back to offline, wifi disconnected, I reconnected it and now wants me to do set up all over again with the app and on computer.",
          "The printer refuses to stay connected to any device, making it impossible to print anything of value.",

          "they are the best.",

          "Was promised a 8:00am call the next day.",
          "Had several issues where they would ask me for information repeatedly that I had already given them.",

          "He had to take over my computer and fix things.",
          "Worst service I've ever had.",

          "They agree to send me a replacement.",
          "Bad service equals bad products.",

          "Said installation failed due to viruses on my computer (I was running PC Matic but that was not good enough) so next he wanted 1800.00 for norton and 3 years tech support on 3 computers?",
          "Have spoken to several people in customer service and have found them, in general, to be argumentative.",
          "I am in my 70’s & not tech savvy & my computer is older which of course took longer to load & he was very patient with me.",

          "I declined and he became very insistent.",
          "This is what irks me about Amazon.",
          "Imagine buying a car only to find out you're only allowed to buy gas at a specific gas station that sells gas for twice the price.This is just a snippet of my problem with this piece of trash.",
          "When calling customer support they immediately wanted to take over my computer to try to find the issue at first I objected and it took three calls before I finally conceive it so I let them go into my computer and they come back and say that my IP address has been compromised.",
          "Troubleshooters are the worst with help.",
          "The customer service person I spoke with eventually resolved this but while I was on hold a child got on the phone and talked about potatoes.",

          "I then used the tech services over the Internet.",
          "Customer service is awful!",

          "His rudeness, and beginning unable to answer any of my questions at one of the worst  customer service experiences I’ve been through",
          "Seriously 2 days later it dropped 50 dollar before taxed and neither company has help resolve this issue.",
          "I also had a problem with one of their techs when i called for service.",

          "The print, copy, and scan quality of this printer is outstanding, which is what I have learned to expect and admire from HP printers.With the last 3 printers I have purchased, there is no question regarding print quality, it is the build integrity.I have had this printer for just over 5 months and now  I am having a paper jamming issue.",
          "I can say that when it prints it's of reasonably good quality, but it doesn't meet my specific needs, which is a printer that prints very rarely, but is on standby and ready to go when called upon.",
          "Great product- so EASY to install and printing has been easy and without issue.",
          "The text is clear and sharp.",
          "Photos can be printed, but don't expect the best quality or to be able to print a large photo.Does not use up ink fast and allows it to last a long time.",
          "Print quality is amazing; easy to setup.",
          "I have not used this printer yet so its performance I cannot say.",
          "It is bulky, often the print quality is poor.",
          "The printer works well and prints quickly and of good quality so far.",
          "I'm not sure if this is fixable and the print quality is still the best I've seen in this price range, but it's a flaw.- the touch screen could be a little more responsive- That's... Really it so far.",
          "The print quality is fine.",
          "Prints well, but set up was difficult.",
          "I appreciate the quality of my copies and the ease it was to install.",
          "Print quality is good, but now-a-days pretty much all printers can \"print\" pretty good quality, so it doesn't set this apart from others.",
          "From an ergonomics standpoint, the monochrome display is bland but the overall appearance is very simple and aesthetically pleasing.",
          "The display on the printer is modest, but notices of any printing problems now pop up on my computer screen.Once again I am glad that I went by Amazon's recommendation.",
          "My only gripe is that the software the manufacturer uses for printing is not the best.",
          "It works well and prints quickly.",
          "The print quality and speed are ideal for home use, WHEN it works, but that's only been about 50 percent of the time I've owned it.I was looking forward to using this printer with an instant ink subscription (advertised as being included for a few months for free), as I've used that with past hp printers I've owned.",
          "Yes, the print quality is outstanding as was the touch screen and Tech Support, the latter being the reason for an overall 3 star rating.",
          "This printer is twice as fast as my old OfficeJet Printer and functions very well from all of my devices with very nice print quality.",
          "Otherwise print quality is good and at a great price.",
          "Prints fast and well.",
          "I was always impressed with the print quality, but on several occasions I forgot to switch to a laser on a print job then printed again, only to stare at both sets of docs in excruciating detail to figure out which was which.",
          "Print quality isn't the best but fine for most home or small office uses, however I was replacing a 7058e model and it just doesn't stand up to the earlier one.",
          "The print quality is not very good on this one.",
          "Printing on plain paper limits the quality of the output--plenty good enough for getting the work done though.My big complaint with this printer, and most inkjets from HP, is the insufferable grinding and rolling and clicking and whatnot the stupid thing does for minutes on end before printing.",
          "While it prints ok (when it prints), I'm not a fan of the overall design.",
          "The print quality is good (based on the three pages I printed so far).",

          "The display is nice and bright and everything printed neatly.",
          "Overall, the print quality is superb and fast.",
          "The print quality was very good out of the box, almost laser printer quality.",
          "Prints very quickly and at a nice quality, both color and black and white.",
          "The print quality of the printer is excellent, but the paper tray and paper output tray are  very flimsy (poor quality)",
          "Prints nice quality black and white as I use it",
          "I don't see how you could print anything larger than the standard size paper.So far set up has gone well .I have to finish it up.After awhile I will update my review and let you folks know how it has gone.I love it so far!",
          "I will say however that the color was great.",
          "Other than that it’s a great size and it prints great.",
          "Color printing is atrociously s-l-o-w",
          "I like the color printing with this printer for personal photos.I'm disappointed with the slowness of the printing action , or the way the paper tray is set up.I haven't tried all the functions yet.",
          "It prints fine, but there are things that arent as nice as the $50 HP  all-in-one that I had previously.",
          "Ink quality is excellent.",
          "Once I do, I'll write a review about print quality.",
          "This printer doesn't print any better or worse or faster or slower than any other printer out there.The rather pricey color in cartridges are terrible.",
          "The print is clear and picture quality is very good, with accurate color rendering.",
          "It does print well, but annoying trying to get the paper to pick  up!",
          "Color?",
          "I did some printing and did not have any issues like some people stated with it not printing due to the ink program.",
          "Makes fine copies, for an ink jet, but I am buying new ink, beginning of January ‘24, when I got it end of October.",
