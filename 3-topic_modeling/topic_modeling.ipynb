          "Then, for no apparent reason, the setup finally completed.",
          "Now I know the difference between software and drivers, and I told tech support that I did not need software just drivers.",
          "Additionally, the software glitched when I needed to print something urgently, incorrectly showing the printer as \"offline.\"",
          "So it's just a brick...or cinderblock.I've had a bunch of other headaches - like called support and spent about 10 minute, the lady asked if I had a Mac or Windows and I told her I set it up on my Android phone but insisted that support can only help with a Mac OS or Windows, so I told her I have a Mac Laptop and she told me it was the wrong department, transferred me, and I got to listen to hold music for another 10 minutes.When the printer worked, it was great.",
          "Sets up real easy and was a breeze to connect to WiFi -- it's quiet, fast, and punches way above its price.",

          "The app is excruciatingly slow already, but then it feels the need to launch my browser and take me to the HP website for all kinds of things that ought to be available at the printer itself, and I cannot believe that the website for a huge company like HP can be so slow and clumsy.",
          "I like the automatic document feeder feature and it works well.",
          "Im very happy with my purchase, great size, great quality, quick connection easy to use.",
          "It is super misleading and I would probably say borderline illegal the way that they portray that you have to sign up for the HP plus software during the set up.",
          "And then, inexplicably,  it wasn’t.",
          "I spent hours on it myself trying to figure it out.",

          "The ink cartridges, which were very easy to replace in my last HP, always get error messages after installation, and it jams regularly.",
          "It still doesn't allow you to use generic ink, though, so it's pointless.-You will be practically forced to download the \"HP smart\" app which is just a slow and barely functioning app that will hit you with an add every 2 minutes pressuring you to SUBSCRIBE TO A MONTHLY INK SUBSCRIPTION.",
          "This printer is pretty noisy while printing, but gets the job done.",
          "Sounds good until you find out HP's idea of \"INSTANT\" ink is actually 10 days.",
          "I have never owned a printer that has stopped working in under a year.",

          "I ended up buying an Epson and it is awesome - no \"smart app\" required, no connection issues, ZERO problems.",
          "Best case scenario since nothing has worked is that they send me these new cartridges that may or may not fix the problem, they don't fix the problem, and then they send me another one of these pieces of you know what, so I still end up with the world's shoddiest printer.",
          "So, no help screens, nothing.",
          "It's so quick and not worth the cost.",
          "I thought this printer looked equivalent to my last however I was wrong.",

          "Print quality is good, but now-a-days pretty much all printers can \"print\" pretty good quality, so it doesn't set this apart from others.",
          "The display is nice and bright and everything printed neatly.",
          "The printer prints nice, everything came packaged properly, but it was missing a printer cord and power cord.",
          "The print quality is not very good on this one.",
          "Overall, the print quality is superb and fast.",
          "Yes, the print quality is outstanding as was the touch screen and Tech Support, the latter being the reason for an overall 3 star rating.",
          "The print quality and speed are ideal for home use, WHEN it works, but that's only been about 50 percent of the time I've owned it.I was looking forward to using this printer with an instant ink subscription (advertised as being included for a few months for free), as I've used that with past hp printers I've owned.",
          "You can definitely multitask w/ this printer , in black /white or color !",
          "Prints very quickly and at a nice quality, both color and black and white.",
          "The printing is great quality, which is the most important.",
          "The prints appear slightly faded in color and slightly blurry.",
          "It does print well, but annoying trying to get the paper to pick  up!",
          "After getting it going and setup, it prints very well.",
          "Photos can be printed, but don't expect the best quality or to be able to print a large photo.Does not use up ink fast and allows it to last a long time.",
          "The print, copy, and scan quality of this printer is outstanding, which is what I have learned to expect and admire from HP printers.With the last 3 printers I have purchased, there is no question regarding print quality, it is the build integrity.I have had this printer for just over 5 months and now  I am having a paper jamming issue.",
          "The printer works well and prints quickly and of good quality so far.",
          "Great product- so EASY to install and printing has been easy and without issue.",
          "Liked the speed and print quality.",
          "Blacks are CRISP and colors are the same, NO smearing at all.",

          "The print quality was very good out of the box, almost laser printer quality.",
          "Printing on plain paper limits the quality of the output--plenty good enough for getting the work done though.My big complaint with this printer, and most inkjets from HP, is the insufferable grinding and rolling and clicking and whatnot the stupid thing does for minutes on end before printing.",
          "Printed perfectly too compared to the print jobs from the genuine cartridges that came with the printer.",

          "I'm not sure if this is fixable and the print quality is still the best I've seen in this price range, but it's a flaw.- the touch screen could be a little more responsive- That's... Really it so far.",
          "This printer doesn't print any better or worse or faster or slower than any other printer out there.The rather pricey color in cartridges are terrible.",
          "The black is not as jet black as one would expect.",
          "this prints boldly, with great indicators of when the ink is running low and easy access to order more.",

          "Colors are vibrant!",
          "My only gripe is that the software the manufacturer uses for printing is not the best.",
          "Prints fast and well.",
          "The print is clear and picture quality is very good, with accurate color rendering.",
          "Print quality isn't the best but fine for most home or small office uses, however I was replacing a 7058e model and it just doesn't stand up to the earlier one.",
          "The text is clear and sharp.",
          "I was always impressed with the print quality, but on several occasions I forgot to switch to a laser on a print job then printed again, only to stare at both sets of docs in excruciating detail to figure out which was which.",
          "Printer quality is fine.",
          "I can say that when it prints it's of reasonably good quality, but it doesn't meet my specific needs, which is a printer that prints very rarely, but is on standby and ready to go when called upon.",
          "The print quality is good (based on the three pages I printed so far).",
          "It prints fine, but there are things that arent as nice as the $50 HP  all-in-one that I had previously.",
          "It is bulky, often the print quality is poor.",
          "I don't see how you could print anything larger than the standard size paper.So far set up has gone well .I have to finish it up.After awhile I will update my review and let you folks know how it has gone.I love it so far!",

          "Just buy your ink on Amazon and many of the third-party inks work just fine the key is when you’re going through the set up on the little touchscreen on the printer and it tells you you have to scan the QR code.",
          "To print ANYTHING, you MUST be online...no internet access...no printing!You can't use third party ink...It refuses to print until 'official' HP ink is installed.This morning, it had a complete meltdown and will not connect to the internet...so I can't print.",
          "For some reason my old HP all in one printer has decided (all of a sudden) that the ink cartridge is not compatible.",
          "We get a notice that now you can only use HP ink and no longer use the off brands, they will no longer work on HP printers.",
          "Connecting from certain devices is impossible.Second, more troubling - generic inks which are cheap will NOT work.",
          "I purchased brand new cartridges from the HP store and they cost more than the printer which was very reasonable price.",
          "I have never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment than I have with this printer - so much so that I am writing a detailed review for the first time in years.Here are the more salient details:-Will not accept ink that is not made by HP which costs about twice as much as other ink.",
          "Did not know about needing to only use hp ink",
          "HP forces you to use their ink products…..otherwise the printer is very good",
          "We called HP several times and they had us go in the phone circle for over an hour.We had to have a contract for ink, and HP MONITORS what is printed and when.There is not ONE good thing I can say about this machine.For the most part, I have to e-mail my print jobs to my work address, and print it there, or send it to my wifes e-mail and have her print it.",
          "It would not use the non-genuine cartridge.",
          "Not anymore.-You can log into your device on a computer to disable cartridge protection, though.",
          "If your printer says it doesn't recognize your aftermarket ink, shut it off, disconnect the printer completely and turn it back on.",
          "If you have problems with a cartridge, you can't just go buy a new HP cartridge - it won't work - you have to wait for a new one to be shipped, so effectively you have no printer.",
          "Does not accept non HP ink.",
          "The printer contacts HP when ink is low, and they ship new cartridges free, without any user intervention.",
          "I have used secondary market ink on printers for years with no issues, but I haven't tried it on this one.",
          "You either have to pay for the top tier hp printer ink and have their service and agree to all their terms to keep your printer even working.",
          "I put the XL cartridge in there and it has locked down the device saying it won’t print unless I put the same stock type in.",
          "the Machine basically stops working when you try to insert non-HP ink.",
          "My previous HP printer is so old that they no longer make ink cartridges for it.",
          "Yes, with the 3rd party cartridge.",
          "I tried to load non-HP ink cartridges but it would not work at all.....I could buy a new one instead of ink.",
          "However, I also didn’t want to pay for HP’s toner at twice or triple the cost of competitor’s toner, which worked just as well and seemed to last just as long as the “genuine” cartridges.",
          "This may apply to all HP printers, but HP has been on a quest to force those who buy their printers to use “genuine HP toner.”  In the past, their machines could detect when a “non HP” cartridge was being used, but this just generated warnings about the quality of non-genuine cartridges being dubious, and the machine would not detect the toner level for you (when it was probably quite capable of doing so).Fine, I don’t fault HP for wanting to sell its own toner.",
          "The e Series locks you into only HP Ink.",
          "Not HP.-In the past, HP would let you \"disable cartridge protection\" on the printer itself which would allow you to use generic ink brands.",
          "However, unlike before, the machine literally refused to print, displaying a message to that effect on the screen and stating that it was due to the non-HP cartridge.",
          "Ordered ink that fits through another company that was budget friendly but HP can detect copy cats and rejects it.",
          "But… if you refill or install a third party cartridge the printer locks up when it recognizes a non HP cartridge.",
          "When the starter toner ran out, that’s when I discovered that HP was taking things to another level…I popped in the 3rd party cartridge, expecting the machine to chastise me for using “non-genuine” toner but ultimately letting me proceed.",
          "I always use HP ink but did not do the HP ink subscription since I do not want to limit my options and want to order ink when I know I need it.",
          "Price the HP brand ink replacement to make sure this is your best option.",
          "Of course, the HP toners are ridiculously expensive.",
          "You positively HAVE to use HP ink, which is so much more expensive than others that should be compatible.",
          "Tried half price bargain brand ink after the 3 month free ink HP supplies, but the printer rejected all cartridges, returned for a refund.",
          "And, of course, if I want to buy replacement cartridges from HP, it costs nearly as much as the printer did.",
          "HP controls when and how you purchase ink.Any ink you received as part of the original purchase  is rendered incompatible with the machine if you purchase/buy any new ink by any means other than the scheme rules of HP.",
          "It rejects anything except an actual HP cartridge.",
          "Of course it only takes branded ink cartridges so I cannot replace it without paying the full price.",
